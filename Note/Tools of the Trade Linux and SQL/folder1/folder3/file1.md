## 🖥️ **How Operating Systems Work**

---

### 1. **The Role of an Operating System**

* Acts like a **car engine**: necessary to run but often hidden from the user.
* **Main Job**: Helps **applications** run efficiently by managing interactions with the hardware.
* Shields users from the complexity of hardware control.

### 2. **What Happens When You Turn on a Computer? (Boot Process)**

* **Step-by-Step Boot Sequence**:

  1. **User presses the power button** (hardware interaction).
  2. **BIOS or UEFI** is activated:

     * **BIOS**: Basic Input/Output System (used in older systems).
     * **UEFI**: Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (used in modern systems).
  3. BIOS/UEFI loads the **bootloader**.
  4. **Bootloader starts the operating system**.

* **Security Insight**:

  * **BIOS/UEFI** can be vulnerable to malware.
  * Antivirus software typically **does not scan BIOS**, so attacks here (e.g., rootkits) are dangerous.

### 3. **How a User Task is Handled (Request Flow)**

#### When a user opens an application (e.g., calculator):

1. **User** clicks the app.
2. **Application** sends a request to the **Operating System**.
3. The **OS communicates** with the relevant **hardware component** (e.g., CPU).
4. **Hardware processes** the task (e.g., performs a calculation).
5. Result is sent **back to the OS**, which passes it **back to the application** for display.

### 4. **Key Components**

* **Application**: A program used to perform a specific task (e.g., web browser, calculator).
* **Operating System**: Manages requests between applications and hardware.
* **Hardware**: Physical parts of the computer (e.g., CPU, RAM, disk, etc.).

---

### 5. **Why This Matters for Cybersecurity**

* As a **security analyst**, understanding how tasks are processed helps:

  * **Trace security incidents** (e.g., malware origin).
  * Analyze **where a vulnerability might have occurred** in the chain (user → application → OS → hardware).
  * Detect **abnormal behaviors** at different stages of execution.

### ✅ **Key Takeaway**

> Just like a mechanic must understand the internal workings of a car, a **security professional must understand how operating systems function** to investigate, protect, and secure computing environments effectively.
