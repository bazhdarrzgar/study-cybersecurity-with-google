### 🎓 **Course Overview**
- Focus: **Foundational computing skills** for cybersecurity.
- Goal: Understand how systems work to better protect them.

---

### 🖥️ **Operating Systems (OS)**
#### 🔍 Why It Matters:
- An OS manages hardware and software interactions.
- **Security analysts** must understand OS behavior to detect vulnerabilities, monitor activity, and respond to threats.

#### 🧠 Core Concepts:
- **Functions of an OS**:
  - Manages hardware resources (CPU, memory, storage).
  - Provides user interface (GUI or CLI).
  - Enforces security policies (user permissions, firewalls).
- **Common OS Types**:
  - Windows, macOS, Linux (focus of this course).

### 🐧 **Linux Operating System**
#### ⚙️ Why Learn Linux?
- Widely used in servers, cloud environments, and security tools.
- Open-source, customizable, and lightweight.

#### 🧩 Key Topics Covered:
1. **Linux Architecture**:
   - Kernel: Core of the OS (manages hardware and processes).
   - Shell: Command-line interface (CLI) for interacting with the system.
   - Utilities: Tools like `grep`, `awk`, and `chmod` for file/system management.

2. **Distributions (Distros)**:
   - Examples: Ubuntu, Kali Linux, CentOS.
   - Kali Linux: Specialized for penetration testing and ethical hacking.

3. **Command-Line Basics**:
   - Navigated directories: `cd`, `ls`, `pwd`.
   - File operations: `cat`, `cp`, `mv`, `rm`.
   - Permissions: `chmod`, `chown` (critical for security audits).
   - Process management: `ps`, `top`, `kill`.

#### 🔐 Security Relevance:
- Many security tools (e.g., Wireshark, Metasploit) run on Linux.
- Understanding Linux helps analyze malware, secure servers, and automate tasks.

### 🗄️ **SQL for Database Querying**
#### 📊 Why SQL Matters for Security:
- Databases store sensitive data (user info, logs, vulnerabilities).
- SQL skills help analyze logs, detect anomalies, and audit access.

#### 🧠 Core Concepts:
1. **Basic Queries**:
   - `SELECT`, `FROM`, `WHERE`: Filter and retrieve data.
   - Example: Find failed login attempts in logs.

2. **Joins**:
   - Combine data from multiple tables to uncover relationships.
   - Types:
     - **INNER JOIN**: Matched rows only.
     - **LEFT/RIGHT JOIN**: Include unmatched rows from one table.
     - **FULL OUTER JOIN**: All rows from both tables.

3. **NULL Values**:
   - Represent missing data (e.g., unassigned devices).
   - Use `IS NULL` or `IS NOT NULL` to filter.

#### 🔍 Security Applications:
- Audit user access: Join user logs with machine records.
- Identify vulnerable systems: Link OS types to known vulnerabilities.
