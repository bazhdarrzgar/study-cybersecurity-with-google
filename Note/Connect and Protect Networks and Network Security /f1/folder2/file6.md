### **Common Network Devices**  

#### **1. Hub**  
- **Function:** Broadcasts data to **all devices** on the network (like a radio tower).  
- **Drawback:** Inefficient and insecure (no targeted traffic).  

#### **2. Switch**  
- **Function:** Directs data **only to the intended device** (unlike a hub).  
- **Advantages:**  
  - More **secure** (reduces unnecessary exposure).  
  - Improves **network performance** by managing traffic flow.  

#### **3. Router**  
- **Function:** Connects **multiple networks** and routes data between them.  
- **Process Example:**  
  1. Computer → Router (sends data).  
  2. Router reads destination address → forwards to recipient’s router.  
  3. Recipient’s router → Final device (e.g., tablet).  

#### **4. Modem**  
- **Function:** Connects a **router to the internet** (enables LAN internet access).  
- **Process Example:**  
  1. Computer → Router → Modem → Internet.  
  2. Recipient’s modem → Router → Device.

### **Virtualization Tools**  
- **Purpose:** Software that replaces physical devices (hubs, switches, routers, modems).  
- **Benefits:**  
  - **Cost savings** and **scalability** (via cloud providers).  
- **Relevance:** Critical for modern cloud-based networks (covered later).

### **Key Takeaways for Cybersecurity**  
- **Switches > Hubs:** Prioritize switches for security (targeted traffic).  
- **Routers:** Essential for inter-network communication (understand routing paths).  
- **Modems:** Attack surface for external threats (e.g., unauthorized access).  
- **Virtualization:** Cloud security implications (shared responsibility model).
