## ✅ **Section 1 Review: Foundations of Security Analysis**

### 1. 📚 **CISSP’s Eight Security Domains**

You explored the broad areas of cybersecurity as outlined by CISSP, giving you a high-level view of the security landscape. These domains cover areas like:

* Security & Risk Management
* Asset Security
* Security Architecture & Engineering
* Communication & Network Security
* Identity & Access Management
* Security Assessment & Testing
* Security Operations
* Software Development Security

### 2. ⚠️ **Threats, Risks, and Vulnerabilities**

You learned how to distinguish between:

* **Threats**: Potential events that could cause harm (e.g., phishing).
* **Risks**: The **likelihood and impact** of those threats.
* **Vulnerabilities**: Weaknesses that can be exploited (e.g., outdated software, weak passwords).

✅ *Key point*: A **risk** exists only when both a threat and a vulnerability are present.

### 3. 💰 **Ransomware and Its Impact**

* Defined as malware that encrypts data and demands payment.
* Can disrupt operations, harm finances, and damage reputations.
* Often tied to the **dark web** for ransom negotiations or data leaks.

---

### 4. 🌐 **Three Layers of the Web**

* **Surface Web**: What most people use (Google, social media, etc.).
* **Deep Web**: Requires login or permission (e.g., intranets).
* **Dark Web**: Accessible only with special tools; often used for illicit activities due to anonymity.

### 5. 🛡️ **NIST Risk Management Framework (RMF)**

You now know the **7 Steps of RMF**:

1. **Prepare**
2. **Categorize**
3. **Select**
4. **Implement**
5. **Assess**
6. **Authorize**
7. **Monitor**

🎯 These steps help organizations manage risk in a structured and proactive way.

* Hands-on with common **security tools** used by analysts.
* **Data analysis** to identify real threats and vulnerabilities.
* Using a **playbook** to respond to security incidents like a pro.
