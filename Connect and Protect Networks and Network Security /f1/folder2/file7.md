### **Cloud Computing Overview**  
- **Definition:** Uses **remote servers/apps** hosted on the internet instead of local physical devices.  
- **Benefits for Companies:**  
  - **Cost reduction** (no need to own/maintain hardware).  
  - **Scalability** (access to on-demand resources).  
  - **Flexibility** (access services from any location).

### **Cloud vs. Traditional Networks**  
| **Traditional Networks**       | **Cloud Networks**                |  
|---------------------------------|-----------------------------------|  
| Devices owned & housed on-site. | Remote servers ("in the cloud").  |  
| Limited geographic access.      | Accessible globally via internet. |  
| Higher maintenance costs.       | Pay-as-you-go pricing model.      |

### **Cloud Security Considerations**  
1. **Shared Responsibility Model:**  
   - Cloud providers secure **infrastructure**.  
   - Customers secure **data, access, and apps**.  
2. **Identity-Based Security:**  
   - Focus shifts to **verifying both traffic source and user identity** (e.g., multi-factor authentication).  
3. **Key Risks:**  
   - Misconfigurations (e.g., exposed storage buckets).  
   - Unauthorized access (weak credentials).

### **Cloud Service Provider (CSP) Offerings**  
- **On-demand resources:** Storage, processing power.  
- **Analytics tools:** Monitor web traffic, sales, and performance.  
- **Examples:** AWS, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure.  

---

### **Why Cloud Security Matters**  
- **Trend:** Organizations are rapidly migrating to the cloud.  
- **Impact:** Cloud security is now a **core part of network security**.  
- **Career Relevance:** Security professionals must understand:  
  - Cloud architecture.  
  - Identity and Access Management (IAM).  
  - Data encryption in transit/at rest.

**Key Takeaway:**  
Cloud networks offer efficiency but introduce new security challengesâ€”prioritize **identity verification** and **shared responsibility** to protect data.
