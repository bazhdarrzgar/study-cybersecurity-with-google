### **Security Zones & Network Segmentation**  

#### **1. What Are Security Zones?**  
- **Definition**: Segments of a network with **unique security rules** to isolate risks.  
- **Purpose**:  
  - Protect internal networks from external threats (e.g., the internet).  
  - Limit damage if a breach occurs (e.g., malware on a guest Wi-Fi won’t spread to payroll servers).

#### **2. Key Zones in a Network**  
| **Zone**               | **Description**                                                                 | **Example**                                  |  
|------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|  
| **Uncontrolled Zone**   | Outside the organization’s control (e.g., the internet).                      | Public Wi-Fi at a hotel.                   |  
| **DMZ (Demilitarized Zone)** | Public-facing services (e.g., websites, email servers). Acts as a buffer between external and internal networks. | Web servers, DNS servers, proxy servers. |  
| **Internal Network**    | Private data/servers (e.g., employee databases, internal tools).              | HR records, financial systems.             |  
| **Restricted Zone**     | Highly confidential data (accessible only to privileged users).               | CEO emails, R&D projects.                  |

#### **3. How Security Zones Work**  
- **Firewalls Separate Zones**:  
  - **1st Firewall**: Filters traffic entering the **DMZ** (e.g., allows only HTTPS to web servers).  
  - **2nd Firewall**: Blocks unauthorized traffic from the **DMZ → Internal Network**.  
  - **3rd Firewall (Optional)**: Protects the **Restricted Zone**.  
- **Example**:  
  - A **university** separates **student Wi-Fi** (untrusted) from **faculty servers** (internal) to prevent attacks from spreading.

#### **4. Benefits of Security Zones**  
✅ **Contain Threats**: Isolates breaches (e.g., a hacked DMZ server won’t compromise internal databases).  
✅ **Granular Control**: Different rules per zone (e.g., only IT admins can access the Restricted Zone).  
✅ **Privacy**: Separates public/private data (e.g., guest Wi-Fi vs. staff payroll systems).

#### **5. Role of a Security Analyst**  
- **Configure Firewalls**: Allow/block traffic between zones (e.g., "Only port 443 for DMZ web servers").  
- **Monitor Logs**: Detect unusual cross-zone traffic (e.g., a student subnet accessing restricted research files).  
- **Update Policies**: Adjust rules as threats evolve (e.g., block new malicious IPs).

#### **6. Key Terms**  
- **Network Segmentation**: Dividing a network into smaller zones for security.  
- **Subnet**: A logical division of a network (e.g., `10.0.1.0/24` for HR, `10.0.2.0/24` for Sales).  

> 🔐 **Pro Tip**: Use **zero-trust principles**—treat all zones as potentially hostile and verify every access request!
