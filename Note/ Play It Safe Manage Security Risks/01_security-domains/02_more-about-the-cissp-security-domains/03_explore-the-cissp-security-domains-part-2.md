## üõ°Ô∏è CISSP Security Domains (Part 2 of 2)

---

### **5. Identity and Access Management (IAM)**

**Goal:**
Limit and control user access to reduce risk.

**Key Components:**

* **Identification:**
  User proves who they are (username, access card, biometrics)
* **Authentication:**
  Verifying identity (password, PIN)
* **Authorization:**
  Granting access based on role or permissions
* **Accountability:**
  Monitoring and logging user actions (e.g., login attempts)

**Example:**
Prevent everyone from sharing one admin login to ensure actions can be traced back to individuals.

### **6. Security Assessment and Testing**

**Focus:**
Evaluate the effectiveness of security controls.

**Activities:**

* Conduct security control testing to verify goals are met
* Collect and analyze security data regularly
* Perform security audits and assessments
* Use findings to improve or add controls (e.g., implement MFA)

---

### **7. Security Operations**

**Focus:**
Respond to and investigate security incidents.

**Process:**

* Detect and investigate incidents quickly to minimize damage
* Mitigate active attacks to protect data
* Collect digital and physical evidence for forensic investigations
* Analyze breaches to improve defenses and prevent future incidents

---

### **8. Software Development Security**

**Focus:**
Integrate security into the software development lifecycle (SDLC).

**Best Practices:**

* Use **secure coding practices** to prevent vulnerabilities
* Perform **security reviews** at every SDLC phase:

  * Secure design reviews during planning
  * Code reviews during development/testing
  * Penetration testing during deployment
* Ensure applications remain secure and data protected throughout development
