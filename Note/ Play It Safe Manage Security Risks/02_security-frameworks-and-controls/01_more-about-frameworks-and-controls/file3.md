## 🛡️ What Are Security Controls?

Security **controls** are **specific measures** or **tools** that help **reduce or manage individual risks**.

> Think of **frameworks** as the **blueprints**, and **controls** as the **tools** used to build and reinforce the structure.

## 🔒 Three Common Types of Controls

### 1. **Encryption**

* **Purpose**: Protect **confidentiality** of data.
* **How it works**: Converts **plaintext** into **ciphertext** (unreadable without a decryption key).
* **Example**: Encrypting a customer's Social Security Number or payment info.

---

### 2. **Authentication**

* **Purpose**: Verify **identity**.
* **Basic example**: Username + password.
* **Advanced methods**:

  * **MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication)** — adds a second layer, like:

    * A code sent to your phone
    * A **biometric** scan (fingerprint, face, voice)

> 🔐 *Biometrics* are unique personal identifiers — very secure, but can be targeted by **vishing** (voice phishing).

---

### 3. **Authorization**

* **Purpose**: Confirm whether a verified person is allowed to access **specific resources**.
* **Example**: Being logged into a federal government system doesn't mean you can view all files — only the ones you're **authorized** for.

---

## 🚨 Why Controls Matter:

Without the right controls:

* Sensitive data can be stolen.
* Systems can be abused (e.g., fake accounts, free benefits).
* Organizations risk **financial loss**, **legal penalties**, and **reputational damage**.
