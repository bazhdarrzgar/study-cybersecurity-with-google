### 🧩 **Key Topics Covered**  
1. **Vulnerability Management Process**  
   - **Defense-in-Depth Model**:  
     - A layered security approach (prevention, detection, response).  
     - Layers work together to create stronger defenses (e.g., firewalls, encryption, access controls).  

2. **CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures)**  
   - A catalog of publicly known security flaws.  
   - Used to prioritize fixes (e.g., patching systems with high-risk CVEs).  

3. **Attack Surfaces**  
   - **Physical**: People, devices, and physical access points (e.g., unattended laptops).  
   - **Digital**: Cloud systems, APIs, and online-connected assets (e.g., remote work tools).  
   - **Cloud Challenges**: Expanded attack surface due to global data accessibility.  

4. **Attack Vectors**  
   - Pathways attackers exploit (e.g., phishing emails, social media, USB drives).  
   - **Internal vs. External Threats**:  
     - Employees (accidental leaks or intentional sabotage).  
     - Cybercriminals targeting vulnerabilities.  

5. **Attacker Mindset**  
   - Ask: *"How would I exploit this system?"*  
   - Steps: Identify target → Determine access → Evaluate vectors → Select tools/methods.

### 🔐 **Defense Strategies Recap**  
- **User Education**: Train employees on risks (e.g., phishing, social media misuse).  
- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Limit access to only what’s needed.  
- **Security Tools**: Firewalls, antivirus, and email filters to reduce human error.  
- **Diverse Security Teams**: Multiple perspectives improve threat detection.

### 🚀 **Upcoming Topics**  
- **Malware**: Explore types (viruses, ransomware, spyware) and how attackers bypass defenses.  
- **Threat Mitigation**: Learn how security teams stop attacks from harming organizations, reputations, and users.

### 💡 **Final Takeaways**  
- **Stay Proactive**: Cybersecurity is about anticipating risks, not just reacting.  
- **Balance Convenience & Security**: Cloud benefits come with expanded attack surfaces.  
- **Think Like an Adversary**: Identifying weaknesses early helps build stronger defenses.
