### üîç **5 Common Types of Malware**  
#### 1. **Virus**  
- **How It Works**:  
  - Attaches to legitimate programs/files. Activates when the file is opened.  
  - Replicates itself to infect other files.  
- **Example**: A Word document infected with a macro virus that corrupts files.  
- **Prevention**: Avoid opening unknown email attachments.  

#### 2. **Worm**  
- **How It Works**:  
  - Self-replicating malware that spreads **without user action**.  
  - Exploits network vulnerabilities to infect connected devices.  
- **Example**: A worm spreading through a company‚Äôs network, crashing systems.  
- **Prevention**: Keep software updated to patch vulnerabilities.  

#### 3. **Trojan (Trojan Horse)**  
- **How It Works**:  
  - Disguised as legitimate software (e.g., fake antivirus tools).  
  - Tricks users into installing it (e.g., via phishing emails or malicious websites).  
  - Often used to install **ransomware** or **spyware**.  
- **Example**: A "free game download" that secretly installs a backdoor.  
- **Prevention**: Only download apps from trusted sources (e.g., official app stores).  

#### 4. **Ransomware**  
- **How It Works**:  
  - Encrypts files/systems and demands payment (e.g., Bitcoin) for decryption.  
  - Attackers reveal themselves to pressure victims into paying.  
- **Example**: A hospital‚Äôs patient records locked until a ransom is paid.  
- **Prevention**: Regular backups, updated systems, and employee training.  

#### 5. **Spyware**  
- **How It Works**:  
  - Secretly collects sensitive data (e.g., passwords, bank details) without consent.  
  - Operates silently in the background.  
- **Example**: Keyloggers stealing login credentials from an infected device.  
- **Prevention**: Use antivirus software and avoid suspicious websites.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Why Malware Matters**  
- **Costly Damage**: Ransomware can shut down businesses; spyware leads to identity theft.  
- **Human Impact**: Loss of critical data (e.g., medical records, personal info).  
- **Evolving Threats**: New malware variants (e.g., fileless malware, AI-powered attacks) emerge constantly.

### üí° **Key Takeaways**  
- **User Vigilance**: Avoid clicking suspicious links, downloading unknown files, or using untrusted USB drives.  
- **Defense Layers**:  
  - Antivirus software.  
  - Regular system updates.  
  - Data backups (to recover from ransomware).  
- **Stay Informed**: Cybercriminals adapt quickly‚Äîkeep up with trends like AI-driven malware or supply chain attacks.

### üöÄ **Next Steps**  
The text mentions exploring **how security teams detect and remove malware**. This includes:  
- **Antivirus tools** (signature-based and behavior-based detection).  
- **Sandboxing** (isolating suspicious files for analysis).  
- **Incident response** (removing malware and restoring systems).
