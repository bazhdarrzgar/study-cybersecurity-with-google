### **Ethics in Cybersecurity: Core Principles**

#### **1. Key Ethical Dilemmas**
- **Scenario 1**: Discovering a friend committed a security violation  
  - *Ethical Duty*: Report impartially (prioritize policies over personal relationships)  
- **Scenario 2**: Unauthorized access to payroll data  
  - *Ethical Duty*: Never abuse privileged access (even if technically possible)  

#### **2. Foundational Ethical Principles**  
| **Principle**       | **Definition**                                  | **Example Violation**                      |  
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|  
| **Confidentiality**  | Protect sensitive data (PII, proprietary info) | Sharing system access outside proper channels |  
| **Privacy**          | Safeguard personal information                 | Disclosing employee contact details unofficially |  
| **Legal Compliance** | Follow laws/regulations                        | Leaving SPII unattended (HIPAA violation)  |  

#### **3. Consequences of Ethical Breaches**  
- Reprimands or job termination  
- Legal penalties (fines/lawsuits)  
- Loss of professional credibility  

#### **Actionable Guidance**  
- **Always**: Adhere to organizational policies, even under pressure.  
- **When Unsure**: Consult legal/ethics teams before acting.  
- **Mindset**: Privileged access = **trust**, not entitlement.  

#### **Why It Matters**  
Ethical lapses erode trust and amplify risks in an already vulnerable digital landscape.
