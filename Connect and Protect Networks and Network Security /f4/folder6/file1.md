## 1. Network Foundations

* **Network Structure**

  * Devices (hosts), routers/switches, links, segments
  * Topologies (star, mesh, bus)
* **Network Architecture**

  * LAN vs. WAN vs. VPN
  * Client-server and peer-to-peer models

## 2. Network Operations & Protocols

* **How Data Travels**

  * OSI and TCP/IP models
  * Key protocols: Ethernet, IP, TCP, UDP, HTTP/S, DNS, ICMP
* **Role of Protocols**

  * Addressing (IP), routing, error checking, flow control

## 3. Common Network Attacks

* **Denial of Service (DoS/DDoS)**

  * SYN floods, ICMP floods, Ping of Death
  * Goal: Overwhelm bandwidth or resources
* **Packet Sniffing**

  * Passive vs. active
  * Captures headers/bodies to read or modify data
* **IP Spoofing**

  * Faking source IP to impersonate trusted hosts
  * On-path (man-in-the-middle), replay, and Smurf attacks

## 4. Defensive Tools & Measures

* **Firewalls & Port Filtering**

  * Block unwanted ports; maintain rulesets
* **Network Segmentation**

  * Create isolated subnets; apply least-privilege access
* **Encryption & Secure Protocols**

  * VPNs, HTTPS (SSL/TLS), strong cipher standards
* **SIEM & Log Analysis**

  * Centralize logs; prioritize and respond to alerts

## 5. Security Hardening

* **OS Hardening**

  * Patch updates, baseline configurations, disposal of old hardware/software
  * Strong password policies and multi-factor authentication
* **Network Hardening**

  * Regular firewall maintenance, patching, backups
  * Port filtering, access controls, segmentation, encryption
* **Cloud Hardening**

  * Shared responsibility model
  * Use baseline server images; separate workloads; apply traditional hardening in the cloud
