### üß† **Security as a Learning Journey**
- **Everyone starts somewhere**:  
  - Cybersecurity is a skill built over time.  
  - The instructor was inspired by the 2017 WannaCry ransomware attack and began studying certifications.  
- **Key reminder**:  
  - No one knows everything at first. Stay curious and patient‚Äîprogress matters more than perfection.

### üîÅ **Recap of Foundational Concepts**
- **Assets & Risk Management**:  
  - Assets (data, systems, devices) must be tracked and protected.  
  - Threats + vulnerabilities = risks that harm organizations.  
- **Digital Challenges**:  
  - Data states (in use, in transit, at rest) require tailored protection strategies.  
- **Security Plans**:  
  - Built using policies, standards, and procedures to reduce risk.  
  - Frameworks like **NIST CSF** guide organizations in managing cybersecurity risks.

### üõ°Ô∏è **Proactive Security Controls**  
*(Focus of the next section)*  
Security controls are **preventive measures** to stop threats before they cause harm.  

#### 1. **Privacy: Data Handling Processes**  
- **Purpose**: Protect sensitive information from unauthorized access.  
- **Key Practices**:  
  - Data minimization: Collect only what‚Äôs necessary.  
  - Anonymization: Remove identifying details from data.  
  - Compliance with privacy laws (e.g., GDPR, CCPA).  

#### 2. **Encryption & Hashing**  
- **Encryption**:  
  - Converts data into unreadable format (ciphertext) to protect it during transmission or storage.  
  - Example: SSL/TLS secures data sent over the internet.  
- **Hashing**:  
  - Converts data into a fixed-length string (hash) to verify integrity.  
  - Example: Passwords are stored as hashes to prevent exposure if breached.  

#### 3. **Access Controls**  
- **Authentication**:  
  - Verifying user identity (e.g., passwords, biometrics, multi-factor authentication).  
- **Authorization**:  
  - Granting users only the access they need (principle of least privilege).  
- **Common Models**:  
  - Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Access based on job roles.  
  - Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC): Access based on user attributes (e.g., location, device type).

### üí° **Takeaway for Students**  
- **Security is proactive**:  
  - Use controls like encryption, hashing, and access management to stop threats early.  
- **Privacy and compliance**:  
  - Protecting data isn‚Äôt just technical‚Äîit‚Äôs ethical and legal.  
- **Next steps**:  
  - Learn how tools like firewalls, antivirus software, and intrusion detection systems enforce these controls.
