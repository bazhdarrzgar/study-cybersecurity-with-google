### **Module 3 Introduction: Protecting Organizations**  

#### **Key Topics Covered**  
1. **Security Frameworks & Controls**  
   - **Purpose**: Standardized approaches to manage risks  
   - **Example**: CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability)  

2. **Security Ethics**  
   - Ethical considerations in cybersecurity practices  

3. **Practical Applications**  
   - **Example**: Security keys for multi-factor authentication (MFA)  

#### **Analogy: Security as a Garden**  
- **Planning**: Research and prepare defenses (e.g., frameworks)  
- **Threats**: Unpredictable risks (e.g., weather/pests = cyber threats)  
- **Adaptation**: Continuous improvements (e.g., policies, monitoring)  

#### **Why It Matters**  
- **Frameworks**: Provide structure for risk management (e.g., NIST, ISO)  
- **Controls**: Implement safeguards (e.g., encryption, access controls)  
- **Ethics**: Ensure trust and accountability in security practices  

#### **Upcoming Focus**  
- Deep dive into **CIA Triad** and real-world control examples.
