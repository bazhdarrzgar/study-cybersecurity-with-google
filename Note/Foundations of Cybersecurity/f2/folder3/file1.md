### **Module Wrap-Up: Key Security Foundations**

#### **1. Historical Attacks Review**
- **Brain Virus (1986)**: First PC virus, unintended spread via floppy disks  
- **Morris Worm (1988)**: First internet worm, led to CERT teams  
- **Modern Relevance**: Today's malware often builds on these early techniques  

#### **2. Digital Age Threats**  
- **LoveLetter (2000)**: First major social engineering attack ($10B+ damages)  
- **Equifax Breach (2017)**: Highlighted consequences of unpatched vulnerabilities ($575M fine)  
- **Key Lesson**: Human factors (social engineering) + technical gaps = catastrophic breaches  

#### **3. CISSP Domains Overview**  
| **Domain Group**       | **Focus Areas**                          |
|-------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| **Part 1** (Domains 1-4)| Risk mgmt, asset security, networks, engineering |
| **Part 2** (Domains 5-8)| IAM, security testing, operations, secure dev |  

#### **Career Takeaways**  
- **Pattern Recognition**: Historical attacks help predict/new threats  
- **Holistic Defense**: Must address both technical vulnerabilities (Equifax) and human factors (LoveLetter)  
- **Domain Synergy**: All 8 CISSP domains interconnect to create robust security  

#### **Final Note**  
Your unique background strengthens the field â€“ diversity drives innovation in cybersecurity.
