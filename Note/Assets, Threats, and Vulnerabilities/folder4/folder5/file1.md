### ðŸ§  **Core Threats in Cybersecurity**  
#### 1. **Social Engineering**  
- **Definition**: Manipulation tactics that exploit human trust (e.g., phishing, pretexting).  
- **Common Techniques**:  
  - **Phishing**: Fraudulent emails/texts (smishing/vishing) tricking users into sharing credentials.  
  - **Pretexting**: Impersonating trusted entities (e.g., IT support) to bypass security.  
- **Defense**:  
  - Train employees to verify requests (e.g., call-back verification).  
  - Use multi-factor authentication (MFA) to reduce credential theft risks.  

#### 2. **Malware**  
- **Types**:  
  - **Ransomware**: Encrypts data until a ransom is paid.  
  - **Trojan**: Disguised as legitimate software to install backdoors.  
  - **Worm**: Self-replicating malware that spreads across networks.  
  - **Cryptojacking**: Secretly uses devices to mine cryptocurrency.  
- **Signs of Infection**:  
  - Slow performance, high CPU usage, unexpected crashes.  
- **Prevention**:  
  - Regular software updates, antivirus tools, and email filtering.  

#### 3. **Web-Based Exploits**  
- **Injection Attacks**:  
  - **SQL Injection (SQLi)**: Injects malicious SQL code into databases via vulnerable input fields (e.g., login forms).  
    - **Defense**: Use **prepared statements** (parameterized queries) and input sanitization.  
  - **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**: Injects malicious scripts into websites to steal cookies/session data.  
    - **Defense**: Validate inputs, use Content Security Policy (CSP), and escape user-generated content.  

#### 4. **Threat Modeling**  
- **Purpose**: Proactively identify and mitigate risks by analyzing assets, vulnerabilities, and threats.  
- **Key Steps**:  
  1. **Define Scope**: Inventory assets (e.g., data, systems).  
  2. **Identify Threat Actors**: Internal (e.g., disgruntled employees) vs. external (e.g., hackers).  
  3. **Build Attack Trees**: Visualize attack paths (e.g., phishing â†’ credential theft).  
  4. **Analyze Risks**: Rank threats using **risk scores** (likelihood Ã— impact).  
  5. **Mitigate Risks**: Choose strategies: avoid, transfer (e.g., insurance), reduce, or accept.  
  6. **Evaluate Findings**: Document fixes and lessons learned.  
- **Frameworks**:  
  - **STRIDE** (Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service, Elevation of Privilege).  
  - **DREAD** (Damage, Reproducibility, Exploitability, Affected Users, Discoverability).

### ðŸ’¡ **Key Takeaways**  
- **Human Factor**: Social engineering and phishing exploit trustâ€”user education is critical.  
- **Proactive Defense**: Use threat modeling to anticipate risks before attackers strike.  
- **Layered Security**: Combine technical controls (e.g., firewalls, CSP) with policies (e.g., least privilege).  
- **Stay Updated**: Malware and exploits evolve rapidlyâ€”regular patching and training are non-negotiable.

### ðŸš€ **Next Steps**  
- **Practice**: Use labs to simulate phishing, SQLi, or XSS attacks.  
- **Explore Tools**: Learn threat modeling with **Microsoft Threat Modeling Tool** or **OWASP methodologies**.  
- **Certifications**: Pursue foundational certs like **CompTIA Security+** or **CEH** to deepen expertise.
