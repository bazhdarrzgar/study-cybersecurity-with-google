## 🧭 **What's Ahead in This Section:**

You’ll explore:

### 1. **Security Frameworks**

* These are structured guidelines designed to help organizations manage cybersecurity risk.
* They provide **best practices, standards, and procedures** that security teams can follow.

**Example:**
🔐 **NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)** — A widely used framework that helps:

* Identify security risks
* Protect against threats
* Detect intrusions
* Respond to incidents
* Recover from attacks

---

### 2. **Security Controls**

* These are the **safeguards and countermeasures** put in place to prevent, detect, and respond to security threats.
* Controls come in three categories:

  * **Administrative** (policies, training)
  * **Technical** (firewalls, encryption)
  * **Physical** (access badges, security cameras)

---

### 3. **Security Design Principles**

* These are fundamental concepts used when designing secure systems.
* They include ideas like:

  * **Least privilege** (users get only the access they need)
  * **Defense in depth** (multiple layers of protection)
  * **Fail securely** (systems fail in a safe manner)

---

### 4. **Security Audits**

* These are formal evaluations of an organization’s security posture.
* They check whether security frameworks and controls are being properly implemented and followed.

✅ *Key takeaway*: Security audits ensure **accountability and continuous improvement** in protecting sensitive data.

## 💡 Why This Matters:

Your work helps prevent real-world consequences—like **identity theft, fraud, job loss, or reputational damage**—for everyday people. This is more than a technical role; it’s a responsibility to protect others.
