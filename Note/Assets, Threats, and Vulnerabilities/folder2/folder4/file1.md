### üõ°Ô∏è **Key Themes in Security: Protecting Assets**
- **Core Goal**: Safeguard organizational and personal assets (data, systems, devices).  
- **Privacy Focus**:  
  - Everyone has the right to decide **who can access their information**.  
  - Requires strict controls to prevent unauthorized exposure.

### üß∞ **Security Controls for Asset Protection**
1. **Principle of Least Privilege**  
   - Users/systems only get **minimum access needed** to perform their tasks.  
   - Reduces risk of accidental or intentional misuse.  

2. **Encryption & Hashing**  
   - **Encryption**:  
     - **Symmetric**: Single key (fast, used for ongoing communication).  
     - **Asymmetric**: Public/private key pair (secure but slower, used for initial trust).  
   - **Hashing**:  
     - One-way process to verify **data integrity** (e.g., detecting file tampering).  
     - Common algorithms: SHA-256, MD5.  

3. **Access Controls**  
   - **Authentication**: Prove identity (e.g., passwords, biometrics).  
   - **Authorization**: Define what users can access (e.g., role-based access).  
   - **Accounting**: Track user activity via **access logs** (detect breaches, monitor sessions).

### üîê **CIA Triad: Foundation of Information Security**
- **Confidentiality**:  
  - Protect sensitive data from unauthorized access (e.g., encryption, access controls).  
- **Integrity**:  
  - Ensure data remains accurate and unaltered (e.g., hashing, version controls).  
- **Availability**:  
  - Guarantee authorized users can access data/systems when needed (e.g., redundancy, backups).

### üîÅ **AAA Framework for Identity Management**
1. **Authentication**:  
   - Verify user identity (e.g., MFA, SSO).  
2. **Authorization**:  
   - Define access rights (e.g., OAuth, role-based policies).  
3. **Accounting**:  
   - Monitor logs to detect anomalies (e.g., failed logins, session hijacking).

### üí° **Takeaway for Students**
- **Security Is Holistic**:  
  - Combine encryption, hashing, access controls, and monitoring to protect assets.  
- **Your Background Matters**:  
  - Diverse perspectives strengthen security teams (e.g., problem-solving, creativity).  
- **Next Step**:  
  - Shift focus to **offensive security** (e.g., understanding attacker tactics, penetration testing).
