* Review and assess an organization’s **security controls**, **policies**, and **procedures**.
* Ensure compliance with **frameworks** (like NIST CSF), **regulations**, and **security principles**.
* Identify risks, improve controls, and prevent fines or breaches.

## 🛠️ **Common Elements of Internal Audits**

### 1. **Establish Scope & Goals** (Audit Planning)

* **Scope**: Define what areas will be reviewed (e.g., user permissions, physical/digital assets, policies, technologies).
* **Goals**: Define the desired outcome (e.g., align with NIST CSF, improve controls, ensure compliance).

> 📌 Example:
>
> * **Scope**: Review of user access, asset tracking, and current tech stack.
> * **Goals**: Implement CSF functions, strengthen access controls, establish compliance policies.

### 2. **Conduct a Risk Assessment** (Audit Planning)

* Identify threats, risks, and vulnerabilities.
* Analyze current weaknesses and evaluate impact to people, data, and systems.
* Input is used to determine needed **security controls** and **compliance adjustments**.

> 📌 Example Issues Identified:
>
> * Inadequate asset management.
> * Unsecured equipment.
> * Weak access control to private data.
