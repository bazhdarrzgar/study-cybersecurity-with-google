### 🔐 **Security Controls: Protecting Information**
- **Purpose**: Reduce risks by safeguarding assets before, during, and after threats.  
- **3 Types of Controls**:  
  1. **Technical Controls**  
     - Tools/technologies to protect data (e.g., encryption, authentication systems).  
  2. **Operational Controls**  
     - Day-to-day practices performed by people (e.g., security training, incident response).  
  3. **Managerial Controls**  
     - Policies, standards, and procedures to guide risk reduction.

### 🛡️ **Information Privacy**
- **Definition**: Protecting data from unauthorized access or sharing.  
- **Key Principle**: Right to **choose when, how, and to what extent** private information is shared.  
- **Example**:  
  - When booking a flight:  
    - Marketing staff shouldn’t access your credit card info.  
    - Customer support agents should only access it during your interaction.

### 🚫 **Principle of Least Privilege**
- **Definition**: Users should only have the minimum access needed to perform their job.  
- **Why It Matters**:  
  - Reduces risk of accidental or intentional misuse of sensitive data.  
  - Example: Restrict access to financial records to only finance team members.

### 🧾 **Data Ownership vs. Custodianship**
1. **Data Owner**  
   - Person who decides who can access, edit, or delete the data.  
   - Example: A manager owns company financial records.  
2. **Data Custodian**  
   - Person/system responsible for storing, handling, or transporting data securely.  
   - Example: A cloud service provider (system) or IT team (people).

### 🗂️ **Data Classification**
- **Purpose**: Categorize data based on sensitivity to determine handling requirements.  
- **Common Classifications**:  
  - Public (e.g., company website content).  
  - Internal (e.g., employee emails).  
  - Confidential (e.g., customer credit card details).  
- **Why It Matters**:  
  - Ensures appropriate security controls are applied to protect data based on its value/risk.

### 💡 **Takeaway for Students**
- **Security controls work together**:  
  - Technical tools, operational practices, and management policies must align to reduce risk.  
- **Privacy is proactive**:  
  - Design systems with the principle of least privilege to protect sensitive data.  
- **Ownership and classification matter**:  
  - Knowing who owns data and how it’s classified ensures proper protection.
