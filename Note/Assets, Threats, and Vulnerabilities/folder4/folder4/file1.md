### üß† **What is Threat Modeling?**  
- **Definition**: A structured process to identify **assets**, their **vulnerabilities**, and **exposure to threats** to prepare for and prevent attacks.  
- **Purpose**: Anticipate risks by analyzing how attackers might target systems, applications, or processes.  
- **Scope**: Applied to entire systems, applications, or business processes.

### üìã **6 Steps of Threat Modeling**  
1. **Define Scope**  
   - Create an inventory of assets (e.g., data, servers, customer info) and classify them by sensitivity.  
2. **Identify Threat Actors**  
   - **Internal**: Employees or insiders (e.g., disgruntled workers).  
   - **External**: Hackers, competitors, or organized crime groups.  
3. **Build Attack Trees**  
   - Diagrams mapping **how threats could exploit assets** (e.g., phishing, malware, insider leaks).  
4. **Characterize the Environment**  
   - Apply an attacker mindset:  
     - Analyze how users, employees, partners, and vendors interact with the system.  
5. **Analyze Threats**  
   - Evaluate existing defenses and identify gaps.  
   - Rank threats using a **risk score** (likelihood √ó impact).  
6. **Mitigate Risk**  
   - Choose a strategy:  
     - **Avoid**: Eliminate the risk (e.g., remove vulnerable software).  
     - **Transfer**: Shift risk (e.g., cyber insurance).  
     - **Reduce**: Implement controls (e.g., firewalls, encryption).  
     - **Accept**: Acknowledge and monitor low-priority risks.  
7. **Evaluate Findings**  
   - Document results, apply fixes, and record lessons learned for future models.

### üîç **Key Concepts**  
- **Threat Actors**:  
  - **Internal**: Employees with access (accidental or intentional harm).  
  - **External**: Hackers, competitors, or nation-state groups.  
- **Attack Trees**:  
  - Visualize attack paths (e.g., phishing ‚Üí credential theft ‚Üí data breach).  
- **Risk Scoring**:  
  - Prioritize threats based on likelihood and potential damage.

### üõ°Ô∏è **Why It Matters**  
- **Proactive Defense**: Identifies weaknesses before attackers exploit them.  
- **Team Effort**: Requires collaboration across IT, security, and business units.  
- **Adaptability**: Tailored to specific targets (e.g., small businesses vs. public utilities).

### üí° **Key Takeaways**  
- Threat modeling is an **advanced but essential skill** for security teams.  
- Use frameworks like **STRIDE** (Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service, Elevation of Privilege) or **DREAD** (Damage, Reproducibility, Exploitability, Affected Users, Discoverability) for structured analysis.  
- Always document findings to improve future defenses.
