### üåê **Web-Based Exploits**  
- **Definition**: Malicious code or behavior that exploits **coding flaws in web applications** to steal data or control systems.  
- **Why They‚Äôre Dangerous**:  
  - Web apps interact with multiple users across networks, making them high-value targets.  
  - Attackers use **injection attacks** to exploit vulnerabilities in input handling.  

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è **Injection Attacks**  
- **How They Work**:  
  - Malicious code is inserted into a vulnerable application (e.g., via forms, URLs, or APIs).  
  - The app executes the code in the background, often without the user noticing.  
- **Root Cause**: Poor input validation/sanitization.  
  - Example: A phone number field expecting "1234567890" accepts malicious scripts instead.

### üî• **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**  
- **Definition**: A type of injection attack where attackers inject malicious scripts (e.g., JavaScript) into trusted websites.  
- **Impact**: Steals sensitive data (e.g., session cookies, geolocation), hijacks webcams/mics, or redirects users to malicious sites.  
- **Languages Exploited**: HTML and JavaScript (commonly used by most websites).

### üß© **3 Types of XSS Attacks**  
#### 1. **Reflected XSS**  
- **How It Works**:  
  - Malicious script is sent to the server and reflected back to the user‚Äôs browser in the server‚Äôs response.  
- **Example**:  
  - A phishing link tricks a user into clicking a URL with embedded malicious code (e.g., `https://trusted-site.com/search?query=<script>alert(1)</script>`).  
  - The server includes the script in its response, and the browser executes it.  
- **Goal**: Steal session cookies or redirect users to fake login pages.  

#### 2. **Stored XSS**  
- **How It Works**:  
  - Malicious script is permanently stored on a server (e.g., in a comment, forum post, or profile field).  
- **Example**:  
  - An attacker submits a comment with embedded JavaScript to a blog. Every user who views the comment runs the script.  
- **Goal**: Infect all visitors to the site without requiring interaction (e.g., stealing credentials at scale).  

#### 3. **DOM-Based XSS**  
- **How It Works**:  
  - Malicious script exists in the web page‚Äôs **Document Object Model (DOM)** (the browser-rendered code).  
  - The attack occurs entirely on the client side (no server interaction needed).  
- **Example**:  
  - A URL parameter (e.g., `https://site.com/theme=color`) allows users to select a theme. An attacker changes the parameter to inject JavaScript:  
    ```  
    https://site.com/theme=<script>maliciousCode()</script>  
    ```  
  - The browser executes the script when loading the page.  
- **Goal**: Bypass server-side protections by exploiting client-side code (e.g., stealing tokens stored in the browser).

### üõ°Ô∏è **Defense Strategies**  
1. **Input Validation & Sanitization**  
   - Reject or clean user inputs that contain unexpected characters (e.g., `<script>` tags).  
2. **Content Security Policy (CSP)**  
   - Restrict which scripts can run on a website (e.g., block inline JavaScript).  
3. **Escaping Data**  
   - Convert special characters (e.g., `<`, `>`) into safe text before displaying them.  
4. **Security Headers**  
   - Use headers like `X-Content-Type-Options` and `X-Frame-Options` to block malicious content.  
5. **Regular Code Audits**  
   - Scan for vulnerabilities using tools like OWASP ZAP or Burp Suite.

### üí° **Key Takeaways**  
- **XSS is Stealthy**: Users often don‚Äôt notice attacks until data is stolen or systems are compromised.  
- **Human Factor**: Developers must anticipate malicious inputs and code defensively.  
- **Proactive Defense**: Secure coding practices (e.g., input validation) are critical to preventing exploits.
