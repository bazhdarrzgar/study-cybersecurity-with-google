### üß† **What is SQL Injection (SQLi)?**  
- **Definition**: A type of **web-based exploit** where attackers inject malicious SQL code into vulnerable input fields (e.g., login forms, search bars) to manipulate or steal data from a database.  
- **Why It Happens**:  
  - Poor **input validation/sanitization** (e.g., allowing raw user input to directly interact with SQL queries).  
  - Developers assuming users will input data correctly, not maliciously.

### ‚öôÔ∏è **How SQL Injection Works**  
1. **Vulnerable Input Fields**:  
   - Web apps use forms (e.g., login, search) to accept user input.  
   - Example: A login form that triggers an SQL query like:  
     ```sql  
     SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'input_username' AND password = 'input_password';  
     ```  
2. **Exploiting the Flaw**:  
   - Attackers input malicious code instead of valid data.  
   - Example: Entering `' OR '1'='1` into the password field:  
     ```sql  
     SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'admin' AND password = '' OR '1'='1';  
     ```  
   - The query becomes always true, bypassing authentication.  

3. **Impact of SQLi Attacks**:  
   - **Steal Sensitive Data**: Extract usernames, passwords, credit card info.  
   - **Modify/Delete Data**: Alter prices in a shopping cart or delete records.  
   - **Gain Admin Access**: Bypass authentication to take control of the database.

### üîç **Types of SQL Injection**  
1. **In-Band SQLi**  
   - **Union-Based**: Uses the `UNION` operator to combine results from multiple queries.  
   - **Error-Based**: Forces the database to display error messages containing sensitive info.  
2. **Blind SQLi**  
   - **Boolean-Based**: Relies on true/false responses to infer data.  
   - **Time-Based**: Delays database responses to extract data bit by bit.  
3. **Out-of-Band SQLi**  
   - Uses external channels (e.g., DNS or HTTP requests) to retrieve data when direct injection isn‚Äôt possible.

### üõ°Ô∏è **Defense Strategies**  
1. **Input Sanitization**  
   - Reject or clean unexpected characters (e.g., quotes, semicolons) in user input.  
2. **Prepared Statements (Parameterized Queries)**  
   - Separate SQL code from data:  
     ```sql  
     SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ? AND password = ?;  
     ```  
   - The database treats user input as data, not executable code.  
3. **Web Application Firewalls (WAFs)**  
   - Block malicious SQL patterns (e.g., `UNION`, `DROP TABLE`) using predefined rules.  
4. **Least Privilege**  
   - Limit database account permissions (e.g., restrict DELETE/UPDATE rights for web apps).  
5. **Security Testing**  
   - Regularly scan for vulnerabilities using tools like **SQLMap** or **OWASP ZAP**.  
6. **Collaboration Between Teams**  
   - Security analysts and developers must work together to test and fix flaws.

### üí° **Key Takeaways**  
- **SQLi is Common**: Exploits trust in user input; affects shopping sites, login systems, and databases.  
- **Prevention is Proactive**: Use prepared statements, sanitize inputs, and validate data rigorously.  
- **Teamwork Matters**: Developers and security teams must collaborate to secure applications.

### üöÄ **Next Steps**  
The text hints at exploring **how security teams prepare for injection attacks** (e.g., threat modeling, penetration testing). Understanding SQLi is foundational for defending against data breaches and protecting critical systems.
