## 🔐 What You Just Learned:

Organizations don’t operate on guesswork when it comes to security — they rely on **frameworks** to develop structured, consistent, and effective security policies.

### ✅ Quick Recap: What Are Security Frameworks?

* **Security frameworks** are **standardized sets of best practices** and **guidelines**.
* They help organizations:

  * **Prevent** attacks (like phishing, ransomware)
  * **Detect** breaches
  * **Respond** effectively to incidents
  * **Protect** both digital and physical assets

---

## 🏢 Why Frameworks Matter in the Real World:

Security threats don't just target systems — they target people too. That's why frameworks also address:

* **Physical security** (e.g., badge access to buildings)
* **Employee awareness** (e.g., phishing training)
* **Incident response** (e.g., who to contact and how)

> ⚠️ *Key Point:* Humans are often the **weakest link** in security. That’s why **employee training and awareness** are integral parts of a strong framework.

Frameworks are the "what" — the **strategy**.
**Controls** are the "how" — the **actions and tools** that make security happen.
