### **Structured Notes: Network Security Recap**  

#### **1. Key Topics Covered**  
1. **Network Protocols**  
   - **TCP**: Ensures reliable data transmission (handshake verification).  
   - **ARP**: Maps IP addresses to MAC addresses for device communication.  
   - **HTTPS**: Encrypts web traffic (uses SSL/TLS for security).  
   - **DNS**: Translates domain names (e.g., `google.com`) into IP addresses.  

2. **VPNs (Virtual Private Networks)**  
   - Secures data on **public networks** by creating an encrypted "tunnel."  
   - Protects privacy and prevents eavesdropping.  

3. **Network Security Tools**  
   - **Firewalls**: Block unauthorized access to/from a network.  
   - **Security Zones**: Isolate network segments (e.g., guest vs. internal traffic).  
   - **Proxy Servers**: Act as intermediaries to filter/monitor web requests.  

#### **2. Why This Matters for Security Analysts**  
- **Daily Tasks**: Debugging traffic, enforcing encryption (HTTPS/WPA3), monitoring VPNs/firewalls.  
- **Goal**: Keep networks **safe, efficient, and private** from attacks.  

#### **3. Quick Review Tips**  
- **Protocols**: Remember "**T**CP = **T**rusted, **A**RP = **A**ddress, **HTTPS = Secure, DNS = Directory**."  
- **Tools**: Firewalls = "bouncers," VPNs = "invisible cloaks," Proxies = "security guards."
