### **Structured Notes: Network Security Fundamentals**  

#### **1. Importance of Network Tools & Protocols**  
- Used daily in **security analysis** to protect networks.  
- Malicious actors exploit **data moving between devices**.  
- Correct **protocols & tools** prevent attacks.  
  - *Example:* Attack detected because the attacker used the **wrong protocol** (even with trusted IP).  

#### **2. Key Topics Covered**  
1. **Common Network Protocols**  
   - Rules for secure data transfer.  
2. **Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)**  
   - Secure remote connections.  
3. **Firewalls, Security Zones & Proxy Servers**  
   - Control & monitor network traffic.  

#### **3. Key Takeaway**  
- Recognizing **abnormal protocols** can stop attacks early.  

*(Focus on learning protocols, VPNs, and firewallsâ€”they are critical for defending networks.)*
