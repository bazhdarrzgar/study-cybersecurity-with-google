### 📚 **Course Structure Overview**
This course covers **four core areas** of security:

#### 1️⃣ **Asset Security**
- **What Are Assets?**
  - Data (customer info, financial records).
  - Systems (servers, apps like Gmail).
  - Physical assets (devices, buildings).
  - Reputation (brand trust, compliance).
- **Why It Matters**:
  - Organizations must identify critical assets to prioritize protection.

#### 2️⃣ **Security Systems & Controls**
- **Definition**: Tools and processes used to protect people and data.
- **Examples**:
  - Firewalls, encryption, access controls.
  - Incident response plans, audits.
- **Goal**: Proactively reduce risks before attacks occur.

#### 3️⃣ **System Vulnerabilities**
- **Common Weaknesses**:
  - Outdated software, weak passwords, misconfigurations.
  - Unpatched systems, insider threats.
- **Mitigation**:
  - Regular updates, penetration testing, monitoring.

#### 4️⃣ **Threats & Threat Modeling**
- **Threats**:
  - Malware, phishing, insider threats, zero-day exploits.
- **Threat Modeling**:
  - Process to identify risks and plan defenses.
  - Steps:
    1. Identify assets.
    2. List potential threats.
    3. Evaluate attack likelihood and impact.
    4. Prioritize defenses.
