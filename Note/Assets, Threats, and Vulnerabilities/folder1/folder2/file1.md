### 🌐 **Why Cybersecurity Matters**
- **Technology dependence**: We rely on smartphones, wearables, and business systems daily.
- **Data explosion**: More technology use = more shared data. Massive amounts of data are created every day.
- **Cybercriminals are evolving**: As businesses use more tech, attackers become more advanced.
- **Data breaches**: Increasingly dangerous due to sensitive data (e.g., personal info, financial records) stored by companies.

### 🧩 **Key Security Concepts**
1. **Assets, Threats, and Vulnerabilities**  
   - **Assets**: Anything valuable (data, systems, devices) that needs protection.  
   - **Threats**: Risks that could harm assets (e.g., hackers, malware, insider attacks).  
   - **Vulnerabilities**: Weaknesses in systems that threats can exploit.

2. **Asset Inventories**  
   - A complete list of company assets.  
   - Helps identify what needs protection.  
   - Critical for managing security risks.

3. **Security Plans**  
   - Built using:  
     - **Policies**: Rules for handling security (e.g., password policies).  
     - **Standards**: Specific requirements to follow (e.g., encryption standards).  
     - **Procedures**: Step-by-step actions to meet policies and standards (e.g., incident response steps).

4. **NIST Cybersecurity Framework**  
   - A widely used guide for creating security plans.  
   - Helps companies protect customers, data, and brand reputation.  
   - Focuses on identifying, protecting, detecting, responding to, and recovering from threats.
