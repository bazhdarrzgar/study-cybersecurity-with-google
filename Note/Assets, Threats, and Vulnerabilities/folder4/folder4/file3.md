### üß† **What is PASTA?**  
- **Definition**: A structured threat modeling framework (Process for Attack Simulation and Threat Analysis).  
- **Purpose**: Align security efforts with business goals while identifying and mitigating risks in systems/applications.  
- **Use Case**: Ideal for applications like mobile apps, cloud systems, or any technology handling sensitive data.

### üìã **7 Stages of the PASTA Framework**  
1. **Define Business & Security Objectives**  
   - **Goal**: Understand the app‚Äôs purpose and security needs.  
   - **Example**: The fitness app aims to protect customer data (e.g., PII, health metrics).  
   - **Key Questions**:  
     - How is personally identifiable information (PII) handled?  
     - What regulations apply (e.g., GDPR)?  

2. **Define Technical Scope**  
   - **Goal**: Identify the app‚Äôs components and attack surface.  
   - **Focus**: Data at rest/in transit, network protocols, APIs, and third-party integrations.  
   - **Example**: Mobile app ‚Üí cloud database ‚Üí user authentication system.  

3. **Decompose the Application**  
   - **Goal**: Map data flow and existing security controls.  
   - **Output**: A **data flow diagram** showing how data moves from user to database.  
   - **Example**: User inputs health data ‚Üí encrypted transmission ‚Üí stored in a secure database.  

4. **Perform Threat Analysis**  
   - **Goal**: Identify potential threats using an attacker mindset.  
   - **Methods**:  
     - Research common attack vectors (e.g., insecure APIs, weak encryption).  
     - Use frameworks like OWASP Mobile Top 10 (e.g., M1: Improper Platform Usage).  

5. **Perform Vulnerability Analysis**  
   - **Goal**: Deep-dive into root causes of vulnerabilities.  
   - **Focus**: Assess weaknesses in code, configurations, or third-party libraries.  
   - **Example**: Outdated SSL/TLS versions exposing data in transit.  

6. **Conduct Attack Modeling**  
   - **Goal**: Simulate attacks to test vulnerabilities.  
   - **Tools**: Create an **attack tree** (visualizing attack paths).  
   - **Example**:  
     - **Target**: Customer usernames/passwords in the database.  
     - **Attack Vector**: SQL injection via unsanitized inputs.  
     - **Mitigation**: Input validation and parameterized queries.  

7. **Analyze Risk & Impact**  
   - **Goal**: Prioritize risks and recommend fixes.  
   - **Actions**:  
     - Assign risk scores (likelihood √ó impact).  
     - Propose solutions (e.g., patching, encryption upgrades).  
   - **Outcome**: Deliver actionable recommendations to stakeholders (e.g., ‚ÄúFix SQL injection vulnerability in login API‚Äù).

### üîç **Key Concepts**  
- **Attack Tree**: A flowchart mapping potential attack paths (e.g., SQL injection ‚Üí data breach).  
- **Data Flow Diagram**: Visualizes how data moves through the system and where controls exist.  
- **Risk Scoring**: Quantifies risks to prioritize fixes (e.g., high-risk = urgent patching).

### üí° **Why PASTA Matters**  
- **Business Alignment**: Ensures security efforts support organizational goals (e.g., protecting customer trust).  
- **Proactive Defense**: Identifies vulnerabilities before attackers exploit them.  
- **Scalability**: Adaptable to complex systems (e.g., mobile apps, cloud infrastructure).

### üìå **Key Takeaways**  
- **PASTA is Iterative**: Revisit models as systems evolve (e.g., new app features).  
- **Collaboration is Key**: Developers, security teams, and stakeholders must work together.  
- **Real-World Example**: The fitness app used PASTA to identify and fix a SQL injection vulnerability before launch.
