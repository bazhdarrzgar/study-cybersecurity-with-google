### 🛡️ **Compliance: Following the Security Plan**
- **What is Compliance?**  
  - Adhering to **internal standards** (company policies) and **external regulations** (laws, industry rules).  
- **Why It Matters**:  
  - Protects trust, reputation, safety, and data integrity.  
  - Avoids fines, penalties, lawsuits (especially in regulated industries like healthcare, energy, finance).  
- **Risks of Non-Compliance**:  
  - Financial loss, legal action, and reputational damage.

### 📜 **Regulations vs. Policies**
- **Regulations**:  
  - Rules set by governments or authorities to control how organizations protect data.  
  - Example: HIPAA (healthcare), GDPR (data privacy in the EU).  
- **Policies**:  
  - Internal company rules to meet regulatory requirements and reduce risk.

### 🧱 **NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)**
- **Purpose**:  
  - A voluntary framework to manage cybersecurity risk, especially for protecting information.  
  - Provides standards, guidelines, and best practices.  
- **3 Main Components**:  
  1. **Core**  
  2. **Tiers**  
  3. **Profiles**

### 🔑 **NIST CSF Core: 5 Functions**  
*(Think of these as a security checklist)*  
1. **Identify**:  
   - Understand assets, risks, and vulnerabilities (e.g., asset management, risk assessment).  
2. **Protect**:  
   - Implement safeguards to limit or contain impacts (e.g., access controls, training).  
3. **Detect**:  
   - Identify threats quickly (e.g., monitoring systems, anomaly detection).  
4. **Respond**:  
   - Take action during a security incident (e.g., incident response plans).  
5. **Recover**:  
   - Restore systems and data after an incident (e.g., backups, recovery plans).

### 📊 **NIST CSF Tiers: Measuring Security Maturity**  
*(Ranges from basic to advanced)*  
- **Tier 1 (Passive)**:  
  - Minimal effort; reactive approach.  
- **Tier 2 (Reactive)**:  
  - Some planning but not formalized.  
- **Tier 3 (Proactive)**:  
  - Formalized processes and risk management.  
- **Tier 4 (Adaptive)**:  
  - Exemplary standards; continuously improves based on lessons learned.

### 📸 **NIST CSF Profiles: Assessing Your Security State**  
- **Purpose**:  
  - Snapshot of your current security posture.  
  - Compare your current profile to a target profile to identify gaps.  
- **Example**:  
  - Like comparing photos of a tree over time to see growth or damage.

### 💡 **Takeaway for Students**  
- **Compliance is cultural**:  
  - Follow policies/regulations to protect data and avoid penalties.  
- **NIST CSF is practical**:  
  - Use its 5 functions to build or improve security plans.  
  - Tiers and profiles help measure progress and identify weaknesses.  
- **Security is proactive**:  
  - Good practices protect people, data, and organizations—not just avoid fines.
