Thanks for the recap! It’s a solid foundation for anyone stepping into cybersecurity — understanding frameworks, controls, principles, audits, and how they all work together really sets the stage.

When you’re ready to dive into **security tools**, just say the word. We can explore common tools like SIEMs, IDS/IPS, vulnerability scanners, endpoint protection, and more — plus how they help analysts detect, respond, and recover from threats.

Looking forward to continuing this journey with you! Anything you want to start with or any questions so far?
