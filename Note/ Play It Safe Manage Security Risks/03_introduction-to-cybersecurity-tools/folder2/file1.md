### 🛠️ **Types of SIEM Tools**

Organizations can choose different SIEM deployment models based on their security, compliance, and infrastructure needs:

1. **Self-Hosted SIEM**

   * Deployed and managed on the organization’s own physical infrastructure
   * ✅ Ideal for organizations needing **physical control** over confidential data
   * ⚙️ Example: **Splunk Enterprise**

2. **Cloud-Hosted SIEM**

   * Managed by the SIEM provider and accessed over the internet
   * ✅ Great for organizations that **don’t want to manage infrastructure**
   * ⚙️ Example: **Splunk Cloud**

3. **Hybrid SIEM**

   * Combines self-hosted and cloud-hosted approaches
   * ✅ Useful for balancing **flexibility with control over sensitive data**
