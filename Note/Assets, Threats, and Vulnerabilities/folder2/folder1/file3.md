### 🛂 **PII (Personally Identifiable Information)**
- **Definition**: Data that can identify an individual.  
- **Examples**:  
  - **Common PII**: Name, email, phone number.  
  - **Sensitive PII**: Bank account numbers, medical records, Social Security numbers.  
- **Why It Matters**:

  - Requires **special handling** to prevent misuse or breaches.

### 🔒 **Data Protection Tips**
1. **Encryption**  
   - **At Rest**: Always encrypt stored data (e.g., databases, files).  
   - **In Transit**: Use **TLS/SSL** to secure data moving over the internet (e.g., online transactions).  

2. **Access Control**  
   - **Limit Access**: Restrict sensitive data to only those who *absolutely* need it.  
   - **Audit Trails**:  
     - Record who accessed data, when, and why.  
     - Regularly review audit logs for unauthorized access.

### 🚨 **Response to PII Breaches**
- **Key Principle**: Treat breaches as personal violations of trust.  
- **Actions**:  
  - Notify affected individuals promptly.  
  - Investigate the cause and strengthen defenses.  
  - Ensure systems are rebuilt to prevent future incidents.

### 🛠️ **Security by Design**
- **Built-In Safety**:  
  - Systems must prioritize security **by default** (not as an afterthought).  
  - Example: Default encryption, automatic updates, secure login protocols.

### 💡 **Takeaway for Students**
- **Protect PII**:  
  - Encrypt data in all states (rest, transit).  
  - Follow the **principle of least privilege** for access control.  
- **Build Trust**:  
  - Security isn’t just technical—it’s about protecting people’s lives and privacy.  
- **Stay Vigilant**:  
  - Audit logs and respond to breaches with empathy and accountability.
