## 🔐 The 5 Core Functions of the NIST CSF

Each function plays a unique and critical role in creating a comprehensive cybersecurity strategy.

| Function        | Description                                                                                                   | Real-World Role                                                                                                             |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🔍 **Identify** | Understand the organization’s environment to manage cybersecurity risks to systems, assets, data, and people. | - Inventory hardware/software<br>- Identify vulnerabilities<br>- Perform risk assessments                                   |
| 🛡️ **Protect** | Safeguard critical services and limit the impact of potential cybersecurity events.                           | - Implement firewalls & access controls<br>- Train employees on security awareness<br>- Keep systems patched and up-to-date |
| 🕵️ **Detect**  | Spot anomalies and potential cybersecurity events quickly.                                                    | - Use threat detection tools<br>- Monitor network traffic<br>- Set up alerting systems for suspicious behavior              |
| 🚨 **Respond**  | Take action once a cybersecurity incident has been detected to contain and resolve it.                        | - Follow an incident response plan<br>- Analyze and document the incident<br>- Notify affected parties                      |
| 🔄 **Recover**  | Restore any capabilities or services that were impaired due to a cybersecurity incident.                      | - Restore backups<br>- Rebuild affected systems<br>- Apply lessons learned to improve response plans                        |

## 🧠 Why This Matters for You

As a **security analyst**, you're not just watching for threats — you're actively **defending systems** and **minimizing harm**. Each of the NIST CSF functions helps you:

* **Prevent threats** before they happen (Identify, Protect)
* **Catch incidents** quickly (Detect)
* **Handle crises** effectively (Respond)
* **Get operations back on track** (Recover)

> 💡 **Tip:** Employers love to see that you understand this framework — it shows you can think both tactically (e.g., responding to alerts) and strategically (e.g., reducing long-term risk).

## 🎯 Takeaway

The five NIST CSF functions create a **life cycle** for handling security:

1. **Know your environment**
2. **Protect what matters**
3. **Detect when something’s off**
4. **Respond quickly**
5. **Recover completely**

This structure helps organizations stay **resilient** and **prepared**, no matter what comes their way.
