### **Structured Notes: Network Protocols & Security**  

#### **1. What Are Network Protocols?**  
- **Definition:** Rules ensuring data reaches the correct destination.  
- **Purpose:** Define the **order of delivery** and **structure of data** between devices.  

#### **2. Key Protocols in Web Browsing (Example: Accessing a Website)**  

1. **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)**  
   - Establishes a **connection** between devices (e.g., your computer & a web server).  
   - Performs a **"handshake"** to verify both devices before data transfer.  

2. **ARP (Address Resolution Protocol)**  
   - Finds the **MAC address** of the next device (like a router) to route data correctly.  

3. **HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure)**  
   - **Securely** sends/receives data between your browser and the website.  
   - Uses **encryption (SSL/TLS)** to protect against hackers.  

4. **DNS (Domain Name System)**  
   - Converts **website names (e.g., `www.yummyrecipesforme.org`)** into **IP addresses**.  
   - Helps data packets find the correct server.  

#### **3. Why Protocols Matter for Security**  
- **HTTPS** prevents data theft by encrypting communication.  
- **TCP handshake** ensures only trusted devices communicate.  
- **Malicious actors** exploit weak protocols—using secure ones (like HTTPS) stops attacks.  

#### **4. Quick Summary**  
- **4 Key Protocols Used in Web Browsing:**  
  - **TCP** → Connection setup  
  - **ARP** → Finds device MAC addresses  
  - **HTTPS** → Secure data transfer  
  - **DNS** → Converts domain names to IPs  
- **Security Benefit:** Proper protocols = **encrypted, verified, and correctly routed data**.
