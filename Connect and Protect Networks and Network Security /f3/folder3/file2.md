# 🎭 IP Spoofing – Cybersecurity Notes

---

## 📌 What is IP Spoofing?

* **IP Spoofing**: A network attack where an attacker **changes the source IP address** in a data packet to impersonate a trusted system.
* **Goal**: Trick a network or firewall into **allowing unauthorized access**.
* The attacker **pretends to be a known, trusted device**.

---

## 🛠️ Common IP Spoofing Attacks

### 1. **On-Path Attack** (also called Man-in-the-Middle)

* Attacker **inserts themselves between two communicating devices**.
* Can **intercept or modify** data.
* Often done between:

  * **User (browser)** ↔ **Server (website)**
* Attacker learns IP and MAC addresses, then **pretends to be one of the devices**.

---

### 2. **Replay Attack**

* Attacker **captures a valid data packet** during a transmission.
* Later, they **resend (replay)** the packet to **impersonate the original sender**.
* Used to:

  * **Disrupt connections**
  * **Bypass authentication**

---

### 3. **Smurf Attack**

* Combines **DDoS** and **IP spoofing**.
* Attacker:

  * Gets a **real IP address** (victim's).
  * Sends **floods of spoofed packets** to it.
* Result: The **target is overwhelmed** and may crash.

## 🛡️ How to Prevent IP Spoofing

### 1. **Use Encryption**

* Protects the data even if it’s intercepted.
* Makes spoofed or replayed packets **useless** without the encryption key.

### 2. **Configure Firewalls Properly**

* Block data packets that:

  * **Come from outside the network**
  * But use **internal IP addresses**
* Create rules to **reject incoming packets** with **spoofed local IPs**.

## 🧠 Key Takeaways

* **IP spoofing** tricks networks by faking the sender’s identity.
* **On-path, replay, and smurf attacks** are common spoofing methods.
* Protect your network with:

  * **Encryption**
  * **Strict firewall rules**
* Always monitor and update network security settings.
