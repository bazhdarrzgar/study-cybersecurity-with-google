### üîê **Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)**
- **Purpose**: Secures the exchange of information online by managing encryption keys and digital certificates.  
- **Goal**: Make secure communication fast, easy, and trusted.

### üîê **Encryption Types in PKI**
#### 1. **Asymmetric Encryption**  
- **How It Works**:  
  - Uses a **public key** (shared openly) to encrypt data.  
  - Uses a **private key** (kept secret) to decrypt data.  
- **Analogy**:  
  - A locked box with two keys:  
    - **Public Key**: Anyone can add items to the box (encrypt).  
    - **Private Key**: Only the owner can open the box (decrypt).  
- **Strengths**:  
  - Secure key exchange (no need to share the private key).  
- **Weaknesses**:  
  - Slower than symmetric encryption due to complex math.  
- **Example**: Used to securely establish connections (e.g., starting a chat app conversation).  

#### 2. **Symmetric Encryption**  
- **How It Works**:  
  - Uses a **single shared key** for encryption and decryption.  
- **Analogy**:  
  - A locked box with one key: Both parties use the same key to add/remove items.  
- **Strengths**:  
  - Faster and simpler for ongoing communication.  
- **Weaknesses**:  
  - Risky key sharing: If the key is intercepted, data is compromised.  
- **Example**: Used after asymmetric encryption to speed up communication (e.g., during a chat session).

### üìÑ **Digital Certificates**
- **Purpose**: Verify identities and establish trust between computers, users, and networks.  
- **How They Work**:  
  1. A company requests a certificate from a **Certificate Authority (CA)**.  
  2. The CA verifies the company‚Äôs identity (e.g., name, country, public key).  
  3. The CA creates a **digital certificate** containing:  
     - Encrypted company data.  
     - The CA‚Äôs **digital signature** (proves authenticity).  
- **Role in PKI**:  
  - Acts like a "digital ID badge" to restrict/grant access to information.  
  - Prevents impersonation (e.g., fake websites).

### üß© **How PKI Combines Encryption & Trust**
1. **Step 1: Secure Key Exchange**  
   - Use **asymmetric encryption** to safely share keys (e.g., during login).  
2. **Step 2: Fast Communication**  
   - Switch to **symmetric encryption** for speed once trust is established.  
3. **Step 3: Verify Identity**  
   - Use **digital certificates** to confirm trust between parties.

### üí° **Takeaway for Students**
- **Encryption Trade-Offs**:  
  - **Asymmetric** = Secure but slow (used for initial trust).  
  - **Symmetric** = Fast but requires secure key sharing (used for ongoing communication).  
- **Key Management**:  
  - Never share private keys or store them insecurely.  
  - Use PKI systems to automate trust and key management.  
- **Real-World Example**:  
  - HTTPS websites use PKI:  
    - Your browser checks the site‚Äôs digital certificate (trusted by a CA).  
    - Asymmetric encryption establishes a secure connection.  
    - Symmetric encryption handles data transfer (e.g., logging in or shopping).
