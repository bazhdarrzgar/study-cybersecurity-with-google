### üîç **Vulnerability Assessment: Finding Weaknesses Before Attackers Do**
- **Definition**:  
  - An internal review process to identify, analyze, and fix security flaws in systems, applications, or networks.  
- **Purpose**:  
  - Prevent attacks by uncovering weaknesses before they‚Äôre exploited.  
  - Ensure security controls meet regulatory standards.  
- **Who Does It?**  
  - Security analysts and IT teams collaborate to perform assessments and prioritize fixes.

### üß© **4-Step Vulnerability Assessment Process**
1. **Identification**  
   - **Goal**: Take a snapshot of the system‚Äôs current security state.  
   - **Methods**:  
     - Automated scanning tools (e.g., Nessus, OpenVAS).  
     - Manual testing (e.g., penetration testing, code reviews).  
   - **Outcome**: A list of potential vulnerabilities (e.g., outdated software, misconfigurations).  

2. **Vulnerability Analysis**  
   - **Goal**: Investigate each vulnerability to understand its root cause.  
   - **Tasks**:  
     - Test if the flaw is exploitable.  
     - Determine how an attacker could exploit it.  
   - **Example**: Validating if a misconfigured firewall allows unauthorized access.  

3. **Risk Assessment**  
   - **Goal**: Prioritize vulnerabilities based on severity and likelihood of attack.  
   - **Factors**:  
     - **Impact**: How damaging would an exploit be (e.g., data breach, system outage)?  
     - **Likelihood**: How easy is it for an attacker to exploit (e.g., known public exploits)?  
   - **Tools**:  
     - **CVSS Scores** (Common Vulnerability Scoring System) from the **CVE List** and **NIST NVD**.  
     - Example: Fix a CVSS 9.0 vulnerability (critical risk) before a CVSS 3.0 (low risk).  

4. **Remediation**  
   - **Goal**: Fix or mitigate high-priority vulnerabilities.  
   - **Actions**:  
     - Apply patches/software updates.  
     - Enforce new security policies (e.g., stronger passwords).  
     - Isolate or replace vulnerable systems.  
   - **Collaboration**: Security teams + IT teams work together to implement fixes.

### üõ†Ô∏è **Key Concepts**
- **Vulnerability vs. Risk**:  
  - **Vulnerability**: A flaw in the system (e.g., unpatched software).  
  - **Risk**: The chance a vulnerability will be exploited + its potential impact.  
- **Tools Used**:  
  - **Scanners**: Identify vulnerabilities at scale.  
  - **CVSS Scores**: Quantify severity (0‚Äì10) to guide prioritization.  
- **Prioritization**:  
  - Focus on vulnerabilities with the highest **impact** and **likelihood** of exploitation.

### üí° **Takeaway for Students**
- **Proactive Defense**:  
  - Vulnerability assessments help organizations fix flaws *before* they become breaches.  
- **Real-World Skills**:  
  - Learn tools like **Nessus**, **OpenVAS**, and **NIST NVD** for scanning and scoring.  
- **Critical Thinking**:  
  - Practice evaluating vulnerabilities using CVSS scores and risk frameworks.  
- **Next Step**:  
  - Explore how attackers identify targets (attack surfaces/vectors) to strengthen your offensive mindset.
