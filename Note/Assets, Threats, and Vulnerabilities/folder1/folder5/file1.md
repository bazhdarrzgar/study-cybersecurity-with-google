### 🧱 **Building Blocks of Organizational Risk Management**
- **Assets**:  
  - Anything valuable (data, systems, devices) that needs protection.  
- **Threats**:  
  - Potential dangers to assets (e.g., hackers, malware, insider risks).  
- **Vulnerabilities**:  
  - Weaknesses in systems that threats can exploit.  

---

### 🗂️ **Asset Inventories**
- **Purpose**: Track all company assets (IP addresses, user data, employee devices).  
- **Why It Matters**:  
  - Easier to protect assets if you know:  
    - Where they are.  
    - Who is responsible for them.

### 🌐 **Challenges in a Rapidly Changing Digital World**
- **Data Protection**:  
  - Must understand if data is:  
    - **In Use** (being accessed).  
    - **In Transit** (moving between locations).  
    - **At Rest** (stored and inactive).  
- **Evolving Threats**:  
  - Attackers constantly develop new methods to bypass defenses.  

---

### 📜 **Security Governance: Policies, Standards, Procedures**
1. **Policies**  
   - Strategic rules to reduce risk (e.g., password policies, acceptable use policies).  
2. **Standards**  
   - Tactical references to meet policy goals (e.g., NIST password guidelines).  
3. **Procedures**  
   - Step-by-step actions to implement policies (e.g., password reset steps).

### 🔐 **NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)**
- **Purpose**: Helps organizations manage cybersecurity risks.  
- **5 Core Functions**:  
  1. **Identify**: Understand assets and risks.  
  2. **Protect**: Implement safeguards (e.g., access controls).  
  3. **Detect**: Identify threats quickly.  
  4. **Respond**: Act during incidents.  
  5. **Recover**: Restore systems after attacks.  
- **Tiers**: Measure maturity (Tier 1 = basic, Tier 4 = advanced).  
- **Profiles**: Snapshot of current vs. target security posture.  

---

### 🚨 **Evolving Threat Landscape**
- **Attackers Are Adapting**:  
  - Hackers continuously improve their skills and tactics.  
- **Security Requires Growth**:  
  - Stay updated on best practices and emerging trends.  
  - Cybersecurity is not static—it demands ongoing learning and adaptation.

### 💡 **Takeaway for Students**
- **Security Is a Journey**:  
  - Master the basics (risk management, data states, governance).  
  - Use frameworks like NIST CSF to build structured plans.  
- **Stay Ahead of Threats**:  
  - Continuous learning is critical to counter evolving cyber risks.  
- **Next Steps**:  
  - Focus on systems security teams use to protect assets (e.g., firewalls, SIEM tools).
