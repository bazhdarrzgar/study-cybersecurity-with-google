* **What is Security Hardening?**
  The process of strengthening systems and networks to reduce vulnerabilities and minimize the attack surface, making it harder for attackers to succeed.

* **OS Hardening:**

  * Regular **patch updates** to fix security flaws
  * Maintaining **baseline configurations** to detect unauthorized changes
  * Proper **hardware and software disposal** to prevent leftover vulnerabilities
  * Implementing **strong password policies** and access controls

* **Network Hardening:**

  * Continuous **network log analysis** and monitoring with tools like SIEM
  * Regular **firewall rule maintenance** and **port filtering**
  * Using **network segmentation** to isolate sensitive areas
  * Enforcing **encryption** standards for data in transit

* **Cloud Network Hardening:**

  * Shared security responsibility between the cloud provider and the organization
  * Use of **baseline server images** to detect changes
  * Separation of data and applications based on sensitivity and function
  * Regular maintenance and monitoring similar to on-premises networks
