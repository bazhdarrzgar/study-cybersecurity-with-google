### 🧠 **Designing With Everyone in Mind**

* Accessibility isn’t just a "nice to have"—it’s **critical for effective security**.
* Security measures (like alerts, authentication steps, and UI elements) should be **tested across a range of abilities** to ensure they're truly usable.

### 🌍 **Universal Benefits from Inclusive Innovation**

* **Closed captioning** was originally for those with hearing impairments, but now benefits **everyone** (e.g., in noisy environments).
* This shows how **inclusive design often leads to better solutions** for all users.

### 💬 **Advice for Newcomers to Cybersecurity**

* Don’t be discouraged by feeling different or like an outsider.
