### **Structured Notes: Wireless Security & Wi-Fi Protocols**  

#### **1. IEEE 802.11 (Wi-Fi) Overview**  
- **Definition**: A set of standards for **wireless LAN (Local Area Network)** communications.  
- **Managed by**: *Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)*.  
- **Purpose**: Ensures wireless connections are **secure and reliable**, matching wired networks.  

#### **2. Wi-Fi Security Evolution**  
1. **WPA (Wi-Fi Protected Access, 2004)**  
   - First major security protocol for Wi-Fi.  
   - Improved encryption over older (insecure) standards like WEP.  

2. **WPA2 (2004 – Present)**  
   - Introduced **AES encryption** (stronger than WPA).  
   - Became the **minimum recommended standard** for secure Wi-Fi.  

3. **WPA3 (2018 – Present)**  
   - Enhanced security features:  
     - **Stronger encryption** (harder to crack).  
     - **Protection against brute-force attacks**.  
     - **Secure public Wi-Fi (individualized encryption)**.  

#### **3. Role of a Security Analyst in Wi-Fi**  
- **Ensure wireless connections** in an organization use **WPA2/WPA3** (never WEP or outdated protocols).  
- **Monitor for unauthorized access** (rogue access points, weak passwords).  
- **Update firmware/routers** to patch vulnerabilities.  

#### **4. Key Takeaways**  
- **Always use WPA3 (or WPA2 if WPA3 isn’t available)**.  
- **Avoid WEP/WPA (obsolete and insecure)**.  
- **Wireless security = encryption + monitoring + updates**.
