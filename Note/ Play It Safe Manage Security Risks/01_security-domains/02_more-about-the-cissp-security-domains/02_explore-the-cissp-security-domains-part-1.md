## 🛡️ CISSP Security Domains (Part 1 of 2)

CISSP identifies **8 domains** used by security teams to:

* Organize daily tasks
* Identify security gaps
* Strengthen **security posture** (an organization's ability to protect and adapt)

---

### **1. Security and Risk Management**

**Focus Areas:**

* **Security Goals & Objectives:**
  Define clear goals to protect sensitive data (e.g. PII)
* **Risk Mitigation:**
  Develop procedures to reduce breach impact quickly
* **Compliance:**
  Ensure alignment with laws, standards, and internal policies
* **Business Continuity:**
  Maintain operations during disasters via recovery plans
* **Legal Regulations & Ethics:**
  Follow regional laws and ethical guidelines to prevent negligence and fraud

🔑 **Why It Matters:**
Strong risk management reduces liability and ensures business survival.

### **2. Asset Security**

**Focus Areas:**

* **Data Lifecycle:**
  Protect data during storage, transfer, maintenance, retention, and destruction
* **Asset Types:**
  Both **digital** (e.g. SPII/PII) and **physical** (e.g. hard drives)
* **Access Control:**
  Know **what data exists**, **where it's stored**, and **who can access it**

🔒 **Example:**
Overseeing destruction of hard drives to prevent data recovery by attackers.

### **3. Security Architecture and Engineering**

**Focus Areas:**

* **Secure System Design:**
  Build infrastructure with layered protections
* **Shared Responsibility:**
  All users play a role in security, not just IT
* **Policies for Reporting:**
  Encourage users to report security concerns early

⚙️ **Key Concept:**
Security is **built-in**, not added later.

---

### **4. Communication and Network Security**

**Focus Areas:**

* **Secure Networks:**
  Protect data in motion—locally, in the cloud, or remotely
* **Wireless & Remote Security:**
  Mitigate risks like insecure Wi-Fi or Bluetooth
* **Access Restrictions:**
  Limit access to risky communications (e.g. public hotspots)

📡 **Example:**
Restrict use of unsecured public Wi-Fi to prevent interception of sensitive data.
