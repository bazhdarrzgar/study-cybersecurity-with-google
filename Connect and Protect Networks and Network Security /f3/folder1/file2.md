### **Why Secure Networks Matter**  

#### **1. Risks of Unsecured Networks**  
- **Data Theft**: Hackers steal **confidential info** (e.g., credit cards, employee records).  
- **Reputation Damage**: Breaches erode **customer trust** (e.g., Home Depot lost 56M payment details in 2014).  
- **Financial Loss**: Attacks cost money to **investigate, mitigate, and recover** (e.g., fines, lawsuits).  
- **Operational Disruption**: **DDoS/packet flooding** crashes services, halting business.

#### **2. Common Network Attacks**  

| **Attack**          | **How It Works**                              | **Impact**                                  |  
|---------------------|---------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|  
| **Malware**         | Infects devices via downloads/emails.       | Data theft, system control.                |  
| **Spoofing**        | Fakes IP/MAC addresses to impersonate trusted devices. | Unauthorized network access.          |  
| **Packet Sniffing** | Intercepts unencrypted data (e.g., passwords). | Privacy breaches.                        |  
| **Packet Flooding** | Overloads networks with fake requests (DDoS). | Service downtime.                        |

#### **3. Real-World Example: Home Depot Breach (2014)**  
- **Attack Method**: Malware on servers stole **56M+ credit/debit cards**.  
- **Consequences**:  
  - **Financial**: $200M+ in fines + fraud losses.  
  - **Reputation**: Customer distrust; brand damage.  
  - **Legal**: GDPR-style penalties (if it happened today).

#### **4. Key Protections**  
- **Encryption**: Use **HTTPS, VPNs, TLS** to protect data in transit.  
- **Firewalls/IDS**: Block malware/spoofing; alert on anomalies.  
- **Network Segmentation**: Isolate critical systems (e.g., payment servers).  
- **Employee Training**: Stop phishing emails that deliver malware.
