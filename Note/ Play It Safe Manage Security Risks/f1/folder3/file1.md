## 🛡️ Understanding Threats, Risks, and Vulnerabilities

### 🔐 **What Is an Asset?**

An **asset** is anything valuable to an organization, including:

* **Physical**: Office spaces, computers
* **Digital**: PII (Personally Identifiable Information), SPII (Sensitive PII)
* **Intellectual Property**: Patents, copyrighted material
* **Data**: Financials, customer records

---

## ⚠️ Threats

A **threat** is:

> Any event or condition that could **negatively impact assets**.

### 🧠 Example:

* **Social Engineering**: Manipulating people to give up confidential information

  * **Phishing**: Fake emails that look real and steal data like usernames, passwords, or banking info

---

## 📉 Risks

A **risk** is:

> The **likelihood** and potential **impact** of a threat exploiting a vulnerability.

### 🔁 Risk = Threat + Vulnerability

### 📊 Risk Levels:

* **Low Risk**: Public info (e.g., website content) — no significant damage if leaked
* **Medium Risk**: Internal business info (e.g., earnings report) — potential financial or reputational impact
* **High Risk**: Regulated or protected info (e.g., SPII, PII, IP) — major damage if compromised

### 🧾 Risk Example:

* No **backup protocols** → High risk of **data loss** in case of an incident

---

## 🕳️ Vulnerabilities

A **vulnerability** is:

> A **weakness** that can be exploited by a threat.

### 💥 Common Vulnerabilities:

* Outdated firewalls or software
* Weak passwords
* Unprotected confidential files
* **People** who are unaware of secure practices

### 🧠 Important:

> There is **no risk** without both a **vulnerability and a threat**.

## 👩‍💻 Role of an Entry-Level Analyst

### ✅ Responsibilities:

* Educate staff about phishing and social engineering
* Encourage reporting of **suspicious activity**
* Monitor and document **access to critical assets**
* Help enforce **access controls** (e.g., access cards for physical spaces)

---

## 🔄 Continuous Improvement

Organizations must:

* Regularly **identify** and **mitigate vulnerabilities**
* Stay alert to **evolving threats**
* Use analysts to **promote a security-conscious culture**
