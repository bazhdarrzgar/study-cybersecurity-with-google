### 📊 **Data: A Critical Organizational Asset**
- **Data** = digital information processed, stored, or transmitted by computers.
- **Why it’s valuable**:  
  - Drives business decisions, customer interactions, and operations.  
  - Breaches can lead to identity theft, financial loss, and reputational damage.  
- **Security teams protect data in three states**:  
  - **In Use**  
  - **In Transit**  
  - **At Rest**

### 🧩 **Three States of Data**
1. **Data in Use**  
   - Definition: Data being accessed or actively used.  
   - Example: Checking emails on a laptop at a park.  

2. **Data in Transit**  
   - Definition: Data moving from one location to another.  
   - Example: Sending an email reply to a friend.  

3. **Data at Rest**  
   - Definition: Data stored on a device and not actively moving.  
   - Example: Email data saved on your laptop when it’s closed.

### 🔒 **Information Security (InfoSec)**
- **Goal**: Protect data in all states from unauthorized access.  
- **Why it matters**:  
  - Weak InfoSec = increased risk of breaches, financial loss, and trust erosion.  
  - Protects organizations, partners, and customers.

### ⚠️ **Challenges in Data Protection**
- **Cloud Complexity**:  
  - Data isn’t truly "at rest" just because a device is idle (e.g., smartphones store data in the cloud).  
- **Evolving Threats**:  
  - New vulnerabilities emerge as technology advances and devices connect globally.  
- **Asset Management**:  
  - Tracking data across its lifecycle (use, transit, rest) is critical for security planning.

### 📚 **Takeaway for Students**
- **Understand data states**:  
  - Knowing where data is and what it’s doing helps analyze risks and build security plans.  
- **Focus on InfoSec**:  
  - Prioritize protecting data in all forms (use, transit, rest) to prevent breaches.  
- **Adapt to change**:  
  - Stay updated on cloud trends and new vulnerabilities in a connected world.
