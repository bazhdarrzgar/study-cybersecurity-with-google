# 🔐 Security Hardening – Key Concepts

---

## 💡 What is Security Hardening?

* **Definition**: Strengthening systems to reduce vulnerabilities and shrink the *attack surface*.
* **Attack Surface**: All possible entry points a hacker can use (e.g., open ports, weak passwords, unused apps).

> 🏠 **Example**: Think of a network like a house. The attack surface = all doors/windows. Hardening = putting strong locks on every one.

## 🔧 What Can Be Hardened?

* **Hardware**
* **Operating Systems**
* **Applications**
* **Computer Networks**
* **Databases**
* **Physical Security** (e.g., cameras, guards)

---

## 🔁 Regular Hardening Tasks:

### ✅ Maintenance & Updates

* Apply **software patches** (fix known security bugs).
* Perform **device configuration changes**.

### ✅ Configuration Examples

* Require **longer/more frequent password changes**.
* **Update encryption standards** to protect stored data.

### ✅ Reduce What’s Not Needed

* **Remove/disable unused apps and services**
* **Disable unused ports**
* **Limit access permissions** to only what’s necessary

> 📉 These actions reduce the number of things you need to monitor and protect.

## 🧪 Penetration Testing (Pen Test)

* A **fake attack** to find weaknesses before real attackers do.
* Helps identify what needs fixing.
* Test results go into a **report** → security team uses this to improve defenses.

---

## 🎯 Why It’s Important:

* Helps **prevent attacks** before they happen.
* **Minimizes damage** if a breach occurs.
* A **core job** of security analysts in any organization.

## 🛠️ Summary

Security hardening:

* Shrinks the attack surface.
* Strengthens systems.
* Keeps attackers out by staying **proactive**, not just reactive.
