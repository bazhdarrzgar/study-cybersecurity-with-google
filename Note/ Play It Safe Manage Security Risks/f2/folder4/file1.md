## 🛡️ OWASP Security Principles — Simplified Guide for Entry-Level Analysts

These principles are part of **secure application and system design** and are used to reduce the risk of exploitation and breach.

| 🧠 Principle                            | 🔍 What It Means                                                                        | 💼 Real-World Example                                                                               |
| --------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1. Minimize the Attack Surface Area** | Limit all the ways an attacker can get into a system.                                   | Disable unused ports/services, remove unnecessary software, block unused APIs.                      |
| **2. Least Privilege**                  | Give users only the access they need to do their jobs—no more.                          | An intern can view reports but not edit them; you can access logs but not change security settings. |
| **3. Defense in Depth**                 | Use **multiple layers** of security controls so that if one fails, others are in place. | MFA + firewalls + IDS + encryption = multiple barriers for attackers.                               |
| **4. Separation of Duties**             | Split critical responsibilities between different people to prevent fraud or abuse.     | The person approving financial transactions isn’t the same person executing them.                   |
| **5. Keep Security Simple**             | Don’t over-engineer solutions—complex systems are hard to manage and secure.            | Simple firewall rules are easier to audit and update than dozens of nested conditions.              |
| **6. Fix Security Issues Correctly**    | Address the **root cause** of a vulnerability and test the solution.                    | Weak Wi-Fi password? Don’t just reset it—implement a stronger policy and test it.                   |

## 🧩 How It All Fits Together

| Framework/Principle  | Focus Area                                                         |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **NIST CSF**         | Strategic incident handling (Identify → Recover)                   |
| **CIA Triad**        | Goals of security: keep data confidential, accurate, and available |
| **OWASP Principles** | Design & implementation strategies to reduce risk                  |

Together, these tools and principles:

* **Prepare you** to work securely and methodically
* **Empower teams** to respond to threats with structure
* **Limit the damage** of breaches when they occur

## 💡 Pro Tip for Interviews or Certifications

If someone asks:

> *"How do you design secure systems?"*

A strong answer:

> “I follow principles like least privilege and defense in depth, backed by frameworks like the NIST CSF and CIA triad. That way, I ensure that security is layered, efficient, and aligned with organizational risk.”

## ✅ Takeaway

You’re learning to **think like a security professional**:

* **Minimize exposure**
* **Limit trust**
* **Layer defenses**
* **Fix issues properly**

Coming up, you’ll likely explore **common attack types**, **incident response**, and **security tools** — all crucial for your future in cybersecurity.
