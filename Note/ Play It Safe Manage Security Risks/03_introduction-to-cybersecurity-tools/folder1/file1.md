### ðŸ”¹ **1. Types of Logs & What They Track**

Logs are the backbone of security monitoring. They provide insight into whatâ€™s happening across systems and networks. Common log types include:

* **System logs** â€“ Track operating system events like shutdowns, reboots, and service failures.
* **Application logs** â€“ Capture events generated by software, like failed login attempts or errors.
* **Security logs** â€“ Record access attempts, firewall activity, and authentication successes/failures.
* **Audit logs** â€“ Focus on user actions, changes to configurations, and permission adjustments.
* **Network logs** â€“ From routers, switches, and firewalls; show traffic flow and access patterns.

Understanding **what to look for** in these logs is critical for detecting anomalies and investigating incidents.

### ðŸ”¹ **2. SIEM Dashboards**

**SIEM (Security Information and Event Management)** systems are centralized platforms that:

* **Collect** data from various log sources
* **Correlate** events for context and timeline
* **Alert** on suspicious or known malicious behavior
* **Visualize** security posture with dashboards

A **SIEM dashboard** displays charts, alerts, risk scores, and timelines. It's your command center for security operations.

As an entry-level analyst, you might:

* Monitor dashboards for real-time alerts
* Use filters to drill down into specific events
* Generate reports for compliance or incident response
