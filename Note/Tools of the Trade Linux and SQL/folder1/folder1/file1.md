### **Computing Basics for Security Analysts**  

#### **1. Why Computing Knowledge Matters in Security**  
- **Protect Systems Better**: Understand what you’re defending (hardware, OS, apps).  
- **Investigate Incidents**: Trace attacks or errors using **Linux commands** or **SQL queries**.  
- **First Line of Defense**: Security analysts stop threats *before* they breach systems.  

---

#### **2. Key Topics Covered**  
1. **Operating Systems (OS)**  
   - How OS bridges **hardware** ↔ **applications**.  
   - Focus: **Linux** (widely used in servers/security tools).  

2. **Linux Command Line**  
   - Essential commands for:  
     - Log analysis (`grep`, `cat`).  
     - File permissions (`chmod`, `chown`).  
     - Network checks (`netstat`, `ping`).  

3. **SQL for Security**  
   - Query databases to:  
     - Track user activity.  
     - Identify suspicious transactions (e.g., `SELECT * FROM logs WHERE activity = 'failed_login'`).

#### **3. Kim’s Career Path**  
- **From Cloud Apps to Security**:  
  - Worked with security teams → Earned **CISSP** → Moved into security.  
- **Key Insight**: Security is **interwoven with all tech**—not a standalone field.  

---

#### **4. Practical Skills You’ll Gain**  
- **Linux**: Navigate servers, analyze logs, manage permissions.  
- **SQL**: Extract data to spot anomalies (e.g., brute-force attacks).  
- **OS Basics**: Know how malware exploits system vulnerabilities.  

> 💡 **Pro Tip**: Practice with:  
> - **Linux**: Try [OverTheWire Bandit](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/).  
> - **SQL**: Use [SQLZoo](https://sqlzoo.net/) for hands-on queries.  

---

#### **5. Why This Matters**  
- **Example**: A log shows `sudo` misuse → Use `grep` to find all suspicious root commands.  
- **Career Boost**: These skills are **required** for 90% of entry-level security jobs.
