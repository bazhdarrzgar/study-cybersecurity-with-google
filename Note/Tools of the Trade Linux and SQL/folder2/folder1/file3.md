## 🛡️ **Linux in Cybersecurity**

---

### 🕰️ **Brief History of Linux**

* **Linus Torvalds** (1991):

  * Created the **Linux kernel** to improve UNIX and make it open-source.
* **Richard Stallman**:

  * Started the **GNU Project**—a free UNIX-like OS.
  * Needed a kernel to complete GNU.
* Together, their work formed what we now call **Linux** (technically **GNU/Linux**).

### 🔓 **What Makes Linux Unique**

* **Open Source**: Anyone can **view, use, modify, and share** the source code.
* **GNU Public License (GPL)**:

  * Governs Linux and many Linux apps.
  * Encourages free use and distribution.
* **Community Driven**:

  * Thousands of developers improve Linux collaboratively.

### 🧪 **Why Linux Is Popular in Security**

* Most-used OS in cybersecurity roles.
* Reliable, secure, and customizable.
* Rich ecosystem of **security-focused tools and distributions**.

---

### 🧰 **How Security Analysts Use Linux**

* **Log Analysis**:

  * Examine system logs (e.g., error logs) to detect issues or anomalies.
* **Access & Authorization**:

  * Verify user credentials and permissions.
  * Key for Identity and Access Management (IAM).
* **Security Tools**:

  * Use specific Linux **distributions** with built-in tools for:

    * **Digital forensics**
    * **Penetration testing** (e.g., Kali Linux)
    * **Network analysis**

---

### 🌱 **Linux Distributions (Distros)**

* Over **600+ distros** exist.
* Created for different users and purposes.

  * Example: **Kali Linux** for offensive security
  * Example: **Parrot OS**, **Ubuntu**, **Debian**, etc.
* You'll explore these in detail later.
