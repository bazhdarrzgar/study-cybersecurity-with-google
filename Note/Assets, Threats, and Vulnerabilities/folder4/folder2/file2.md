### üß† **Malware Evolution**  
- **Historical Context**:  
  - Early malware was used for digital vandalism (e.g., pranks or chaos).  
  - Today, malware is a **profit-driven crime** (e.g., ransomware, cryptojacking).

### üîç **2 Key Types of Modern Malware**  
#### 1. **Ransomware**  
- **Purpose**: Encrypts data/systems and demands payment (e.g., Bitcoin) for decryption.  
- **Impact**: Disrupts businesses, hospitals, and individuals.  
- **Trend**: Attackers often threaten to leak stolen data if ransom isn‚Äôt paid (double extortion).  

#### 2. **Cryptojacking**  
- **Definition**: Malware that secretly uses a victim‚Äôs device to mine cryptocurrency.  
- **How It Works**:  
  - Infects devices via vulnerable servers, malicious ads, or phishing emails.  
  - Runs background processes to solve complex code puzzles (mining).  
- **Why It‚Äôs Profitable**:  
  - Attackers avoid electricity/software costs by hijacking victims‚Äô resources.  
- **Example**:  
  - A website injects cryptojacking code into a visitor‚Äôs browser without consent.

### üîç **Signs of Cryptojacking Infection**  
- **Device Slowdown**: Unusual lag or freezing.  
- **High CPU Usage**: Fans run loudly even when idle.  
- **Battery Drain**: Rapid battery depletion on laptops/phones.  
- **Crashes**: Frequent system crashes or overheating.  
- **Costly Electricity Bills**: Sudden spikes in energy usage due to mining.

### üõ°Ô∏è **Detection & Defense Strategies**  
1. **Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)**  
   - Monitors system activity and alerts on anomalies (e.g., crypto mining processes).  
   - **Limitation**: New malware variants may evade detection.  

2. **Preventative Measures**  
   - **Browser Extensions**: Use blockers like NoCoin or MinerBlock.  
   - **Ad Blockers**: Prevent malicious ads from running cryptojacking scripts.  
   - **Disable JavaScript**: Reduces attack surface (use browser extensions like NoScript).  
   - **User Education**: Train employees to avoid suspicious links/files.  

3. **System Hardening**  
   - Keep software updated to patch vulnerabilities (e.g., outdated plugins).  
   - Use endpoint protection tools (e.g., antivirus with behavior-based detection).

### üí° **Key Takeaways**  
- **Malware is Evolving**: Attackers adapt to new technologies (e.g., crypto mining, AI-driven attacks).  
- **Cryptojacking is Stealthy**: It‚Äôs hard to detect but harms performance and increases costs.  
- **Layered Defense**: Combine technical tools (IDS, blockers) with user awareness.  
- **Stay Updated**: Cybercriminals innovate constantly‚Äîregular training and patching are critical.

The text mentions exploring **how security teams detect and remove malware**, including:  
- **Sandboxing**: Isolating suspicious files for analysis.  
- **Incident Response**: Steps to contain, eradicate, and recover from infections.
