### **Security Frameworks & Controls: Core Concepts**  

#### **1. Security Frameworks**  
- **Purpose**: Structured plans to mitigate risks to data/privacy  
- **Key Functions**:  
  - Identify/document security goals (e.g., GDPR compliance)  
  - Set guidelines (e.g., data handling policies)  
  - Implement processes (e.g., user data request procedures)  
  - Monitor/report results (e.g., network issue alerts)  

#### **2. Security Controls**  
- **Definition**: Safeguards to reduce specific risks  
- **Example**:  
  - Mandatory privacy training + automated tracking for employees  

#### **3. Real-World Applications**  
- **GDPR Compliance**:  
  - Document compliance gaps  
  - Design procedures for user data requests (update/delete profiles)  
  - Report violations to compliance officers  

#### **Why It Matters**  
- **Risk Management**: Frameworks standardize how organizations address threats.  
- **Collaboration**: Analysts work with teams to implement policies.  
- **Entry-Level Focus**: Understand controls (e.g., training tools) to support security goals.  

#### **Key Takeaway**  
Frameworks + controls = **proactive defense** against breaches and compliance failures.
