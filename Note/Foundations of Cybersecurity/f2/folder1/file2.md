### **Historical Cyber Attacks: Key Lessons**

#### **1. Brain Virus (1986)**
- **Creators**: Alvi brothers (Pakistan)
- **Original Purpose**: Track pirated medical software copies
- **Actual Impact**:
  - Infected boot sectors of floppy disks
  - Spread globally within months
  - Slowed systems but didn't destroy data
- **Industry Impact**:
  - First PC virus
  - Highlighted need for anti-piracy solutions
  - Demonstrated unintended consequences of malware

#### **2. Morris Worm (1988)**
- **Creator**: Robert Morris (Cornell grad student)
- **Original Purpose**: Measure internet size
- **Critical Flaw**: 
  - No infection tracking â†’ recursive reinfections
- **Damage**:
  - Crashed ~6,000 machines (10% of 1988 internet)
  - $100K-$10M in cleanup costs (estimates vary)
- **Lasting Legacy**:
  - Led to creation of first CERT teams
  - Inspired modern patch management systems

#### **Key Takeaways**
1. **Unintended Consequences**: Even "benign" malware can cause widespread damage
2. **Defense Evolution**: These attacks shaped:
   - Anti-virus software
   - Incident response protocols
   - Network monitoring tools
3. **Modern Relevance**: 
   - Same propagation principles used in today's ransomware
   - Early examples of "trust" exploitation in systems

#### **Security Analyst Relevance**
- Understanding attack histories helps:
  - Recognize attack patterns
  - Develop better prevention strategies
  - Appreciate why certain security controls exist
