## 🌐 **Understanding Network Fundamentals**

### 🧱 **1. Network Structure (Architecture)**

* Learn the basic building blocks of a network:

  * **Devices** (e.g., routers, switches, firewalls, endpoints)
  * **Connections** (wired & wireless)
  * **Topologies** (like star, mesh, bus, etc.)
* Understand how data moves through these components.

---

### 🛠️ **2. Standard Networking Tools**

* Tools used to monitor, test, and troubleshoot networks:

  * Examples: `ping`, `traceroute`, `netstat`, `Wireshark`, etc.
* How these tools help detect issues and ensure security.

---

### ☁️ **3. Cloud Networks**

* What cloud networks are and how they differ from traditional networks.
* Basic concepts like:

  * **Public vs. private clouds**
  * **Hybrid architectures**
  * **Virtual networks and security in the cloud**

---

### 📡 **4. The TCP/IP Model**

* A foundational framework for how devices communicate on a network.
* Understand its **4 layers**:

  1. **Link Layer** – physical network connections
  2. **Internet Layer** – addressing and routing (IP)
  3. **Transport Layer** – data delivery (TCP/UDP)
  4. **Application Layer** – services like HTTP, FTP, DNS, etc.

### 🎯 **Why This Matters for Security Analysts**

* Network threats often exploit weaknesses in structure or misconfigurations.
* By learning how networks **work**, you’ll know how to:

  * Detect anomalies
  * Harden weak points
  * Respond quickly to network-based attacks
