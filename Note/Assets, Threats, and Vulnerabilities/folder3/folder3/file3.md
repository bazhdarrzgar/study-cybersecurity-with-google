### 🛡️ **Attack Vectors**  
- **Definition**: Pathways attackers use to breach systems (e.g., social media, USB drives, phishing emails).  
- **Examples**:  
  - Social media (e.g., employees accidentally sharing sensitive info).  
  - Removable media (e.g., infected USB drives).  
- **Who Uses Them?**:  
  - Malicious hackers (external threats).  
  - Employees (unintentional or intentional internal threats).

### 🎯 **Attacker Mindset Process**  
1. **Identify Target**: Data, systems, people, or organizations.  
2. **Determine Access**: What info is available to exploit? (e.g., employee credentials, public data leaks).  
3. **Evaluate Vectors**: Which pathways can be exploited? (e.g., phishing, unpatched software).  
4. **Select Tools/Methods**: Malware, social engineering, zero-day exploits.

### 🔐 **Defense Strategies**  
1. **User Education**  
   - Train employees on risks (e.g., phishing scams, social media pitfalls).  
   - Tie training to real-world events (e.g., new ransomware trends).  

2. **Principle of Least Privilege**  
   - Restrict access rights to *only what’s needed* for a task.  
   - Reduces internal risks and limits lateral movement by attackers.  

3. **Security Tools**  
   - Deploy antivirus, firewalls, and email filters to catch human errors (e.g., accidental clicks on malicious links).  

4. **Build a Diverse Security Team**  
   - Different perspectives improve threat detection and creative problem-solving.  
   - Encourages applying an attacker mindset proactively.

### ☁️ **Impact of Cloud Computing**  
- **Expanded Attack Surface**:  
  - Data accessible globally = more entry points for attackers.  
  - Remote work and third-party services increase complexity.  
- **Balancing Act**:  
  - Trade convenience (cloud access) for heightened security risks.

### 🧠 **Key Takeaways**  
- **Think Like an Attacker**: Identify weaknesses before adversaries do.  
- **Layered Defenses**: Combine education, policies, and tools.  
- **Adapt to Modern Threats**: Cloud and remote work demand flexible, proactive security strategies.
