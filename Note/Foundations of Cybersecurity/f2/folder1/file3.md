### **Digital Age Cyber Attacks: Key Case Studies**

#### **1. LoveLetter Attack (2000)**
- **Type**: Social engineering + malware hybrid
- **Attack Vector**: 
  - Email with "I Love You" subject line
  - Malicious attachment ("Love Letter For You.txt.vbs")
- **Propagation**: 
  - Auto-sent to all contacts
  - Stole passwords/credentials
- **Impact**:
  - 45 million infected computers
  - $10B+ in global damages
- **Key Lesson**: 
  - First major proof of social engineering effectiveness
  - Highlighted need for email security awareness

#### **2. Equifax Breach (2017)**
- **Vulnerabilities Exploited**:
  - Unpatched Apache Struts flaw (CVE-2017-5638)
  - Poor network segmentation
  - Weak credential management
- **Data Stolen**:
  - 143 million records (40% of US population)
  - SSNs, birth dates, credit cards, addresses
- **Aftermath**:
  - $575M settlement (largest at the time)
  - New focus on vulnerability management

#### **Critical Security Concepts**
1. **Social Engineering**:
   - Manipulates human psychology
   - Modern variants: phishing, smishing, vishing
   - Defense: Regular employee training

2. **Attack Surface Expansion**:
   - Digital connectivity â†’ more entry points
   - Cloud/SaaS adoption creates new vulnerabilities

3. **Multi-Layer Failures**:
   - Equifax showed security isn't just one control
   - Need defense-in-depth strategy

#### **Security Analyst Takeaways**
- Must understand both:
  - Technical vulnerabilities
  - Human factor weaknesses
- Key responsibilities:
  - Vulnerability patch management
  - Security awareness training
  - Threat pattern recognition

#### **Modern Relevance**
- These attack methods still used today in:
  - Business Email Compromise (BEC)
  - Ransomware campaigns
  - Supply chain attacks
