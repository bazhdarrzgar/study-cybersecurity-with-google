- **Transition to Security**:  
  - Database admin → Cybersecurity via certifications (like this program)

1. **Common Violations**:  
   - Password sharing  
   - Unauthorized data access (e.g., snooping on colleagues/celebrities)  
   - *Root Cause*: Shortcuts/laziness, not malice  

2. **High-Stakes Example**:  
   - Post-9/11 request to search text messages without legal documentation  
   - *Ethical Action*: Refused without written authorization (despite senior pressure)  

#### **Ethical Decision-Making**  
- **Ask**: "What are the consequences of my actions?"  
- **Guidelines**:  
  - Always require formal authorization for sensitive requests  
  - Prioritize organizational policies over hierarchical pressure  

#### **Why Ethics Matter**
