### ðŸ§  **Core Concepts Covered**  
#### 1. **Asset Management & Classification**  
- **Digital Assets**:  
  - Data in **three states**: at rest, in transit, in use.  
  - **Classification**: Prioritize protection based on sensitivity (e.g., PII, financial data).  
- **Policies & Standards**:  
  - Mitigate risk through frameworks like **NIST Cybersecurity Framework** (Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover).  

#### 2. **Security Controls & Systems**  
- **Encryption**:  
  - Protects data confidentiality (e.g., AES, RSA).  
- **Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)**:  
  - Ensures trust via digital certificates (e.g., TLS/SSL for secure web traffic).  
- **Access Controls**:  
  - **AAA Framework**: Authentication (verify identity), Authorization (grant permissions), Accounting (track activity).  

#### 3. **Vulnerabilities & Attack Surfaces**  
- **Defense-in-Depth**:  
  - Layered security (firewalls, intrusion detection, encryption) to protect data exchanges.  
- **Common Vulnerabilities**:  
  - **CVE List**: Catalog of publicly known flaws (e.g., Log4j, EternalBlue).  
  - **Attack Surfaces**:  
    - **Physical**: Devices, people (e.g., unattended laptops).  
    - **Digital**: Cloud systems, APIs, third-party integrations.  

#### 4. **Threats & Exploits**  
- **Social Engineering**:  
  - **Phishing**: Fraudulent emails/texts (smishing/vishing) to steal credentials.  
  - **Defense**: User training, multi-factor authentication (MFA).  
- **Malware**:  
  - **Types**: Ransomware, trojans, worms, cryptojacking.  
  - **Prevention**: Antivirus, patching, least privilege.  
- **Web-Based Exploits**:  
  - **SQL Injection**: Inject malicious SQL via vulnerable input fields.  
  - **XSS**: Steal session cookies via malicious scripts in websites.  
  - **Defense**: Input sanitization, Content Security Policy (CSP), prepared statements.  

#### 5. **Threat Modeling**  
- **Process**:  
  1. Define scope (inventory assets).  
  2. Identify threat actors (internal/external).  
  3. Build **attack trees** (visualize attack paths).  
  4. Analyze risks (likelihood Ã— impact).  
  5. Mitigate risks (avoid, transfer, reduce, accept).  
  6. Evaluate findings (document fixes/lessons learned).  
- **Frameworks**: STRIDE, DREAD.

### ðŸ’¡ **Key Takeaways**  
- **Human Factor**: Social engineering exploits trustâ€”user education is critical.  
- **Layered Defense**: Combine technical controls (e.g., firewalls) with policies (e.g., least privilege).  
- **Proactive Risk Management**: Use threat modeling to anticipate attacks before they happen.  
- **Stay Updated**: Malware and exploits evolve rapidlyâ€”regular patching and training are non-negotiable.
